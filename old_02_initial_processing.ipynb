It is hoped that the following historical account of the discovery, partial utilization, and almost complete extermination of the great American bison may serve to cause the public to fully realize the folly of allowing all our most valuable and interesting American mammals to be wantonly destroyed in the same manner. The wild buffalo is practically gone forever, and in a few more years, when the whitened bones of the last bleaching skeleton shall have been picked up and shipped East for commercial uses, nothing will remain of him save his old, well-worn trails along the water-courses, a few museum specimens, and regret for his fate. If his untimely end fails even to point a moral that shall benefit the surviving species of mammals _which are now being slaughtered in like manner_, it will be sad indeed. Although _Bison americanus_ is a true bison, according to scientific classification, and not a buffalo, the fact that more than sixty millions of people in this country unite in calling him a \"buffalo,\" and know him by no other name, renders it quite unnecessary for me to apologize for following, in part, a harmless custom which has now become so universal that all the naturalists in the world could not change it if they would. W. T. H. THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON, By WILLIAM T. HORNADAY, _Superintendent of the National Zoological Park._ PART I.--LIFE HISTORY OF THE BISON. I. DISCOVERY OF THE SPECIES. The discovery of the American bison, as first made by Europeans, occurred in the menagerie of a heathen king. In the year 1521, when Cortez reached Anahuac, the American bison was seen for the first time by civilized Europeans, if we may be permitted to thus characterize the horde of blood thirsty plunder seekers who fought their way to the Aztec capital. With a degree of enterprise that marked him as an enlightened monarch, Montezuma maintained, for the instruction of his people, a well-appointed menagerie, of which the historian De Solis wrote as follows (1724): \"In the second Square of the same House were the Wild Beasts, which were either presents to Montezuma, or taken by his Hunters, in strong Cages of Timber, rang\\'d in good Order, and under Cover: Lions, Tygers, Bears, and all others of the savage Kind which New-Spain produced; among which the greatest Rarity was the Mexican Bull; a wonderful composition of divers Animals. It has crooked Shoulders, with a Bunch on its Back like a Camel; its Flanks dry, its Tail large, and its Neck cover\\'d with Hair like a Lion. It is cloven footed, its Head armed like that of a Bull, which it resembles in Fierceness, with no less strength and Agility.\" Thus was the first seen buffalo described. The nearest locality from whence it could have come was the State of Coahuila, in northern Mexico, between 400 and 500 miles away, and at that time vehicles were unknown to the Aztecs. But for the destruction of the whole mass of the written literature of the Aztecs by the priests of the Spanish Conquest, we might now be reveling in historical accounts of the bison which would make the oldest of our present records seem of comparatively recent date. Nine years after the event referred to above, or in 1530, another Spanish explorer, Alvar Nuñez Cabeza, afterwards called Cabeza de Vaca--or, in other words \"Cattle Cabeza,\" the prototype of our own distinguished \"Buffalo Bill\"--was wrecked on the Gulf coast, west of the delta of the Mississippi, from whence he wandered westward through what is now the State of Texas. In southeastern Texas he discovered the American bison on his native heath. So far as can be ascertained, this was the earliest discovery of the bison in a wild state, and the description of the species as recorded by the explorer is of historical interest. It is brief and superficial. The unfortunate explorer took very little interest in animated nature, except as it contributed to the sum of his daily food, which was then the all-important subject of his thoughts. He almost starved. This is all he has to say:[1] [Note 1: Davis\\' Spanish Conquest of New Mexico. 1869. P. 67.] \"Cattle come as far as this. I have seen them three times, and eaten of their meat. I think they are about the size of those in Spain. They have small horns like those of Morocco, and the hair long and flocky, like that of the merino. Some are light brown (_pardillas_) and others black. To my judgment the flesh is finer and sweeter than that of this country [Spain]. The Indians make blankets of those that are not full grown, and of the larger they make shoes and bucklers. They come as far as the sea-coast of Florida [now Texas], and in a direction from the north, and range over a district of more than 400 leagues. In the whole extent of plain over which they roam, the people who live bordering upon it descend and kill them for food, and thus a great many skins are scattered throughout the country.\" Coronado was the next explorer who penetrated the country of the buffalo, which he accomplished from the west, by way of Arizona and New Mexico. He crossed the southern part of the \"Pan-handle\" of Texas, to the edge of what is now the Indian Territory, and returned through the same region. It was in the year 1542 that he reached the buffalo country, and traversed the plains that were \"full of crooke-backed oxen, as the mountaine Serena in Spaine is of sheepe.\" This is the description of the animal as recorded by one of his followers, Castañeda, and translated by W. W. Davis:[2] [Note 2: The Spanish Conquest of New Mexico. Davis. 1869. Pp. 206-7.] \"The first time we encountered the buffalo, all the horses took to flight on seeing them, for they are horrible to the sight. \"They have a broad and short face, eyes two palms from each other, and projecting in such a manner sideways that they can see a pursuer. Their beard is like that of goats, and so long that it drags the ground when they lower the head. They have, on the anterior portion of the body, a frizzled hair like sheep\\'s wool; it is very fine upon the croup, and sleek like a lion\\'s mane. Their horns are very short and thick, and can scarcely be seen through the hair. They always change their hair in May, and at this season they really resemble lions. To make it drop more quickly, for they change it as adders do their skins, they roll among the brush-wood which they find in the ravines. \"Their tail is very short, and terminates in a great tuft. When they run they carry it in the air like scorpions. When quite young they are tawny, and resemble our calves; but as age increases they change color and form. \"Another thing which struck us was that all the old buffaloes that we killed had the left ear cloven, while it was entire in the young; we could never discover the reason of this. \"Their wool is so fine that handsome clothes would certainly be made of it, but it can not be dyed for it is tawny red. We were much surprised at sometimes meeting innumerable herds of bulls without a single cow, and other herds of cows without bulls.\" Neither De Soto, Ponce de Leon, Vasquez de Ayllon, nor Pamphilo de Narvaez ever saw a buffalo, for the reason that all their explorations were made south of what was then the habitat of that animal. At the time De Soto made his great exploration from Florida northwestward to the Mississippi and into Arkansas (1539-\\'41) he did indeed pass through country in northern Mississippi and Louisiana that was afterward inhabited by the buffalo, but at that time not one was to be found there. Some of his soldiers, however, who were sent into the northern part of Arkansas, reported having seen buffalo skins in the possession of the Indians, and were told that live buffaloes were to be found 5 or 6 leagues north of their farthest point. The earliest discovery of the bison in Eastern North America, or indeed anywhere north of Coronado\\'s route, was made somewhere near Washington, District of Columbia, in 1612, by an English navigator named Samuel Argoll,[3] and narrated as follows: \"As soon as I had unladen this corne, I set my men to the felling of Timber, for the building of a Frigat, which I had left half finished at Point Comfort, the 19. of March: and returned myself with the ship into Pembrook [Potomac] River, and so discovered to the head of it, which is about 65 leagues into the Land, and navigable for any ship. And then marching into the Countrie, I found great store of Cattle as big as Kine, of which the Indians that were my guides killed a couple, which we found to be very good and wholesome meate, and are very easie to be killed, in regard they are heavy, slow, and not so wild as other beasts of the wildernesse.\" [Note 3: Purchas: His Pilgrimes. (1625.) Vol. IV, p. 1765. \"A letter of Sir Samuel Argoll touching his Voyage to Virginia, and actions there. Written to Master Nicholas Hawes, June, 1613.\"] It is to be regretted that the narrative of the explorer affords no clew to the precise locality of this interesting discovery, but since it is doubtful that the mariner journeyed very far on foot from the head of navigation of the Potomac, it seems highly probable that the first American bison seen by Europeans, other than the Spaniards, was found within 15 miles, or even less, of the capital of the United States, and possibly within the District of Columbia itself. The first meeting of the white man with the buffalo on the northern boundary of that animal\\'s habitat occurred in 1679, when Father Hennepin ascended the St. Lawrence to the great lakes, and finally penetrated the great wilderness as far as western Illinois. The next meeting with the buffalo on the Atlantic slope was in October, 1729, by a party of surveyors under Col. William Byrd, who were engaged in surveying the boundary between North Carolina and Virginia. As the party journeyed up from the coast, marking the line which now constitutes the interstate boundary, three buffaloes were seen on Sugar-Tree Creek, but none of them were killed. On the return journey, in November, a bull buffalo was killed on Sugar-Tree Creek, which is in Halifax County, Virginia, within 5 miles of Big Buffalo Creek; longitude 78° 40\\' W., and 155 miles from the coast.[4] \"It was found all alone, tho\\' Buffaloes Seldom are.\" The meat is spoken of as \"a Rarity,\" not met at all on the expedition up. The animal was found in thick woods, which were thus feelingly described: \"The woods were thick great Part of this Day\\'s Journey, so that we were forced to scuffle hard to advance 7 miles, being equal in fatigue to double that distance of Clear and Open Ground.\" One of the creeks which the party crossed was christened Buffalo Creek, and \"so named from the frequent tokens we discovered of that American Behemoth.\" [Note 4: Westover Manuscript. Col. William Byrd. Vol. I, p. 178.] In October, 1733, on another surveying expedition, Colonel Byrd\\'s party had the good fortune to kill another buffalo near Sugar-Tree Creek, which incident is thus described:[5] [Note 5: Vol. II, pp. 24, 25.] \"We pursued our journey thro\\' uneven and perplext woods, and in the thickest of them had the Fortune to knock down a Young Buffalo 2 years old. Providence threw this vast animal in our way very Seasonably, just as our provisions began to fail us. And it was the more welcome, too, because it was change of dyet, which of all Varietys, next to that of Bed-fellows, is the most agreeable. We had lived upon Venison and Bear till our stomachs loath\\'d them almost as much as the Hebrews of old did their Quails. Our Butchers were so unhandy at their Business that we grew very lank before we cou\\'d get our Dinner. But when it came, we found it equal in goodness to the best Beef. They made it the longer because they kept Sucking the Water out of the Guts in imitation of the Catauba Indians, upon the belief that it is a great Cordial, and will even make them drunk, or at least very Gay.\" A little later a solitary bull buffalo was found, _but spared_,[6] the earliest instance of the kind on record, and which had few successors to keep it company. [Note 6: _Ib._, p. 28.] II. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION. The range of the American bison extended over about one-third of the entire continent of North America. Starting almost at tide-water on the Atlantic coast, it extended westward through a vast tract of dense forest, across the Alleghany Mountain system to the prairies along the Mississippi, and southward to the Delta of that great stream. Although the great plains country of the West was the natural home of the species, where it flourished most abundantly, it also wandered south across Texas to the burning plains of northeastern Mexico, westward across the Rocky Mountains into New Mexico, Utah, and Idaho, and northward across a vast treeless waste to the bleak and inhospitable shores of the Great Slave Lake itself. It is more than probable that had the bison remained unmolested by man and uninfluenced by him, he would eventually have crossed the Sierra Nevadas and the Coast Range and taken up his abode in the fertile valleys of the Pacific slope. Had the bison remained for a few more centuries in undisturbed possession of his range, and with liberty to roam at will over the North American continent, it is almost certain that several distinctly recognizable varieties would have been produced. The buffalo of the hot regions in the extreme south would have become a short-haired animal like the gaur of India and the African buffalo. The individuals inhabiting the extreme north, in the vicinity of Great Slave Lake, for example, would have developed still longer hair, and taken on more of the dense hairyness of the musk ox. In the \"wood\" or \"mountain buffalo\" we already have a distinct foreshadowing of the changes which would have taken place in the individuals which made their permanent residence upon rugged mountains. It would be an easy matter to fill a volume with facts relating to the geographical distribution of _Bison americanus_ and the dates of its occurrence and disappearance in the multitude of different localities embraced within the immense area it once inhabited. The capricious shiftings of certain sections of the great herds, whereby large areas which for many years had been utterly unvisited by buffaloes suddenly became overrun by them, could be followed up indefinitely, but to little purpose. In order to avoid wearying the reader with a mass of dates and references, the map accompanying this paper has been prepared to show at a glance the approximate dates at which the bison finally disappeared from the various sections of its habitat. In some cases the date given is coincident with the death of the last buffalo known to have been killed in a given State or Territory; in others, where records are meager, the date given is the nearest approximation, based on existing records. In the preparation of this map I have drawn liberally from Mr. J. A. Allen\\'s admirable monograph of \"The American Bison,\" in which the author has brought together, with great labor and invariable accuracy, a vast amount of historical data bearing upon this subject. In this connection I take great pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to Professor Allen\\'s work. While it is inexpedient to include here all the facts that might be recorded with reference to the discovery, existence, and ultimate extinction of the bison in the various portions of its former habitat, it is yet worth while to sketch briefly the extreme limits of its range. In doing this, our starting point will be the Atlantic slope east of the Alleghanies, and the reader will do well to refer to the large map. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.--There is no indisputable evidence that the bison ever inhabited this precise locality, but it is probable that it did. In 1612 Captain Argoll sailed up the \"Pembrook River\" to the head of navigation (Mr. Allen believes this was the James River, and not the Potomac) and marched inland a few miles, where he discovered buffaloes, some of which were killed by his Indian guides. If this river was the Potomac, and most authorities believe that it was, the buffaloes seen by Captain Argoll might easily have been in what is now the District of Columbia. Admitting the existence of a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the Pembrook River of Captain Argoll, there is yet another bit of history which fairly establishes the fact that in the early part of the seventeenth century buffaloes inhabited the banks of the Potomac between this city and the lower falls. In 1624 an English fur trader named Henry Fleet came hither to trade with the Anacostian Indians, who then inhabited the present site of the city of Washington, and with the tribes of the Upper Potomac. In his journal (discovered a few years since in the Lambeth Library, London) Fleet gave a quaint description of the city\\'s site as it then appeared. The following is from the explorer\\'s journal: \"Monday, the 25th June, we set sail for the town of Tohoga, where we came to an anchor 2 leagues short of the falls. * * * This place, without question, is the most pleasant and healthful place in all this country, and most convenient for habitation, the air temperate in summer and not violent in winter. It aboundeth with all manner of fish. The Indians in one night commonly will catch thirty sturgeons in a place where the river is not above 12 fathoms broad, and as for deer, buffaloes, bears, turkeys, the woods do swarm with them. * * * The 27th of June I manned my shallop and went up with the flood, the tide rising about 4 feet at this place. We had not rowed above 3 miles, but we might hear the falls to roar about 6 miles distant.\"[7] [Note 7: Charles Burr Todd\\'s \"Story of Washington,\" p. 18. New York, 1889.] MARYLAND.--There is no evidence that the bison ever inhabited Maryland, except what has already been adduced with reference to the District of Columbia. If either of the references quoted may be taken as conclusive proof, and I see no reason for disputing either, then the fact that the bison once ranged northward from Virginia into Maryland is fairly established. There is reason to expect that fossil remains of _Bison americanus_ will yet be found both in Maryland and the District of Columbia, and I venture to predict that this will yet occur. VIRGINIA.--Of the numerous references to the occurrence of the bison in Virginia, it is sufficient to allude to Col. William Byrd\\'s meetings with buffaloes in 1620, while surveying the southern boundary of the State, about 155 miles from the coast, as already quoted; the references to the discovery of buffaloes on the eastern side of the Virginia mountains, quoted by Mr. Allen from Salmon\\'s \"Present State of Virginia,\" page 14 (London, 1737), and the capture _and domestication_ of buffaloes in 1701 by the Huguenot settlers at Manikintown, which was situated on the James River, about 14 miles above Richmond. Apparently, buffaloes were more numerous in Virginia than in any other of the Atlantic States. NORTH CAROLINA.--Colonel Byrd\\'s discoveries along the interstate boundary between Virginia and North Carolina fixes the presence of the bison in the northern part of the latter State at the date of the survey. The following letter to Prof. G. Brown Goode, dated Birdsnest post-office, Va., August 6, 1888, from Mr. C. R. Moore, furnishes reliable evidence of the presence of the buffalo at another point in North Carolina: \"In the winter of 1857 I was staying for the night at the house of an old gentleman named Houston. I should judge he was seventy then. He lived near Buffalo Ford, on the Catawba River, about 4 miles from Statesville, N. C. I asked him how the ford got its name. He told me that his grandfather told him that when he was a boy the buffalo crossed there, and that when the rocks in the river were bare they would eat the moss that grew upon them.\" The point indicated is in longitude 81° west and the date not far from 1750. SOUTH CAROLINA.--Professor Allen cites numerous authorities, whose observations furnish abundant evidence of the existence of the buffalo in South Carolina during the first half of the eighteenth century. From these it is quite evident that in the northwestern half of the State buffaloes were once fairly numerous. Keating declares, on the authority of Colhoun, \"and we know that some of those who first settled the Abbeville district in South Carolina, in 1756, found the buffalo there.\"[8] This appears to be the only definite locality in which the presence of the species was recorded. [Note 8: Long\\'s Expedition to the Source of the St. Peter\\'s River, 1823, II, p. 26.] GEORGIA.--The extreme southeastern limit of the buffalo in the United States was found on the coast of Georgia, near the mouth of the Altamaha River, opposite St. Simon\\'s Island. Mr. Francis Moore, in his \"Voyage to Georgia,\" made in 1736 and reported upon in 1744,[9] makes the following observation: [Note 9: Coll. Georgia Hist. Soc., I, p. 117.] \"The island [St. Simon\\'s] abounds with deer and rabbits. There are no buffalo in it, though there are large herds upon the main.\" Elsewhere in the same document (p. 122) reference is made to buffalo-hunting by Indians on the main-land near Darien. In James E. Oglethorpe\\'s enumeration (A. D. 1733) of the wild beasts of Georgia and South Carolina he mentions \"deer, elks, bears, wolves, and buffaloes.\"[10] [Note 10: Ibid., I, p. 51.] Up to the time of Moore\\'s voyage to Georgia the interior was almost wholly unexplored, and it is almost certain that had not the \"large herds of buffalo on the main-land\" existed within a distance of 20 or 30 miles or less from the coast, the colonists would have had no knowledge of them; nor would the Indians have taken to the war-path against the whites at Darien \"under pretense of hunting buffalo.\" ALABAMA.--Having established the existence of the bison in northwestern Georgia almost as far down as the center of the State, and in Mississippi down to the neighborhood of the coast, it was naturally expected that a search of historical records would reveal evidence that the bison once inhabited the northern half of Alabama. A most careful search through all the records bearing upon the early history and exploration of Alabama, to be found in the Library of Congress, failed to discover the slightest reference to the existence of the species in that State, or even to the use of buffalo skins by any of the Alabama Indians. While it is possible that such a hiatus really existed, in this instance its existence would be wholly unaccountable. I believe that the buffalo once inhabited the northern half of Alabama, even though history fails to record it. LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI.--At the beginning of the eighteenth century, buffaloes were plentiful in southern Mississippi and Louisiana, not only down to the coast itself, from Bay St. Louis to Biloxi, but even in the very Delta of the Mississippi, as the following record shows. In a \"Memoir addressed to Count de Pontchartrain,\" December 10, 1697, the author, M. de Remonville, describes the country around the mouth of the Mississippi, now the State of Louisiana, and further says:[11] \"A great abundance of wild cattle are also found there, which might be domesticated by rearing up the young calves.\" Whether these animals were buffaloes might be considered an open question but for the following additional information, which affords positive evidence: \"The trade in furs and peltry would be immensely valuable and exceedingly profitable. We could also draw from thence a great quantity of buffalo hides every year, as the plains are filled with the animals.\" In the same volume, page 47, in a document entitled \"Annals of Louisiana from 1698 to 1722, by M. Penicaut\" (1698), the author records the presence of the buffalo on the Gulf coast on the banks of the Bay St. Louis, as follows: \"The next day we left Pea Island, and passed through the Little Rigolets, which led into the sea about three leagues from the Bay of St. Louis. We encamped at the entrance of the bay, near a fountain of water that flows from the hills, and which was called at this time Belle Fountain. We hunted during several days upon the coast of this bay, and filled our boats with the meat of the deer, buffaloes, and other wild game which we had killed, and carried it to the fort (Biloxi).\" [Note 11: Hist. Coll. of Louisiana and Florida, B. F. French, 1869, first series, p. 2.] The occurrence of the buffalo at Natchez is recorded,[12] and also (p. 115) at the mouth of Red River, as follows: \"We ascended the Mississippi to Pass Manchac, where we killed fifteen buffaloes. The next day we landed again, and killed eight more buffaloes and as many deer.\" [Note 12: Ibid., pp. 88-91.] The presence of the buffalo in the Delta of the Mississippi was observed and recorded by D\\'Iberville in 1699.[13] [Note 13: Hist. Coll. of Louisiana and Florida, French, second series, p. 58.] According to Claiborne,[14] the Choctaws have an interesting tradition in regard to the disappearance of the buffalo from Mississippi. It relates that during the early part of the eighteenth century a great drought occurred, which was particularly severe in the prairie region. For three years not a drop of rain fell. The Nowubee and Tombigbee Rivers dried up and the forests perished. The elk and buffalo, which up to that time had been numerous, all migrated to the country beyond the Mississippi, and never returned. [Note 14: Mississippi as a Province, Territory, and State, p. 484.] TEXAS.--It will be remembered that it was in southeastern Texas, in all probability within 50 miles of the present city of Houston, that the earliest discovery of the American bison on its native heath was made in 1530 by Cabeza de Vaca, a half-starved, half-naked, and wholly wretched Spaniard, almost the only surviving member of the celebrated expedition which burned its ships behind it. In speaking of the buffalo in Texas at the earliest periods of which we have any historical record, Professor Allen says: \"They were also found in immense herds on the coast of Texas, at the Bay of St. Bernard (Matagorda Bay), and on the lower part of the Colorado (Rio Grande, according to some authorities), by La Salle, in 1685, and thence northwards across the Colorado, Brazos, and Trinity Rivers.\" Joutel says that when in latitude 28° 51\\' \"the sight of abundance of goats and bullocks, differing in shape from ours, and running along the coast, heightened our earnestness to be ashore.\" They afterwards landed in St. Louis Bay (now called Matagorda Bay), where they found buffaloes in such numbers on the Colorado River that they called it La Rivière aux Boeufs.[15] According to Professor Allen, the buffalo did not inhabit the coast of Texas east of the mouth of the Brazos River. [Note 15: The American Bisons, Living and Extinct, p. 132.] It is a curious coincidence that the State of Texas, wherein the earliest discoveries and observations upon the bison were made, should also now furnish a temporary shelter for one of the last remnants of the great herd. MEXICO.--In regard to the existence of the bison south of the Rio Grande, in old Mexico, there appears to be but one authority on record, Dr. Berlandier, who at the time of his death left in MS. a work on the mammals of Mexico. At one time this MS. was in the Smithsonian Institution, but it is there no longer, nor is its fate even ascertainable. It is probable that it was burned in the fire that destroyed a portion of the Institution in 1865. Fortunately Professor Allen obtained and published in his monograph (in French) a copy of that portion of Dr. Berlandier\\'s work relating to the presence of the bison in Mexico,[16] of which the following is a translation: [Note 16: The American Bisons, pp. 129-130.] \"In Mexico, when the Spaniards, ever greedy for riches, pushed their explorations to the north and northeast, it was not long before they met with the buffalo. In 1602 the Franciscan monks who discovered Nuevo Leon encountered in the neighborhood of Monterey numerous herds of these quadrupeds. They were also distributed in Nouvelle Biscaye (States of Chihuahua and Durango), and they sometimes advanced to the extreme south of that country. In the eighteenth century they concentrated more and more toward the north, but still remained very abundant in the neighborhood of the province of Bexar. At the commencement of the nineteenth century we see them recede gradually in the interior of the country to such an extent that they became day by day scarcer and scarcer about the settlements. Now, it is not in their periodical migrations that we meet them near Bexar. Every year in the spring, in April or May, they advance toward the north, to return again to the southern regions in September and October. The exact limits of these annual migrations are unknown; it is, however, probable that in the north they never go beyond the banks of the Rio Bravo, at least in the States of Cohahuila and Texas. Toward the north, not being checked by the currents of the Missouri, they progress even as far as Michigan, and they are found in summer in the Territories and interior States of the United States of North America. The route which these animals follow in their migrations occupies a width of several miles, and becomes so marked that, besides the verdure destroyed, one would believe that the fields had been covered with manure. \"These migrations are not general, for certain bands do not seem to follow the general mass of their kin, but remain stationary throughout the whole year on the prairies covered with a rich vegetation on the banks of the Rio de Guadelupe and the Rio Colorado of Texas, not far from the shores of the Gulf, to the east of the colony of San Felipe, precisely at the same spot where La Salle and his traveling companions saw them two hundred years before. The Rev. Father Damian Mansanet saw them also as in our days on the shores of Texas, in regions which have since been covered with the habitations, hamlets, and villages of the new colonists, and from whence they have disappeared since 1828.\" [Illustration: HEAD OF BUFFALO BULL From specimen in the National Museum Group. Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the publishers.] \"From the observations made on this subject we may conclude that the buffalo inhabited the temperate zone of the New World, and that they inhabited it at all times. In the north they never advanced beyond the 48th or 58th degree of latitude, and in the south, although they may have reached as low as 25°, they scarcely passed beyond the 27th or 28th degree (north latitude), at least in the inhabited and known portions of the country.\" NEW MEXICO.--In 1542 Coronado, while on his celebrated march, met with vast herds of buffalo on the Upper Pecos River, since which the presence of the species in the valley of the Pecos has been well known. In describing the journey of Espejo down the Pecos River in the year 1584, Davis says (Spanish Conquest of New Mexico, p. 260): \"They passed down a river they called _Rio de las Vacas_, or the River of Oxen [the river Pecos, and the same Cow River that Vaca describes, says Professor Allen], and was so named because of the great number of buffaloes that fed upon its banks. They traveled down this river the distance of 120 leagues, all the way passing through great herds of buffaloes.\" Professor Allen locates the western boundary of the buffalo in New Mexico even as far west as the western side of Rio Grande del Norte. UTAH.--It is well known that buffaloes, though in very small numbers, once inhabited northeastern Utah, and that a few were killed by the Mormon settlers prior to 1840 in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake. In the museum at Salt Lake City I was shown a very ancient mounted head of a buffalo bull which was said to have been killed in the Salt Lake Valley. It is doubtful that such was really fact. There is no evidence that the bison ever inhabited the southwestern half of Utah, and, considering the general sterility of the Territory as a whole previous to its development by irrigation, it is surprising that any buffalo in his senses would ever set foot in it at all. IDAHO.--The former range of the bison probably embraced the whole of Idaho. Fremont states that in the spring of 1824 \"the buffalo were spread in immense numbers over the Green River and Bear River Valleys, and through all the country lying between the Colorado, or Green River of the Gulf of California, and Lewis\\' Fork of the Columbia River, the meridian of Fort Hall then forming the western limit of their range.\" [In J. K. Townsend\\'s \"Narrative of a Journey across the Rocky Mountains,\" in 1834, he records the occurrence of herds near the Mellade and Boise and Salmon Rivers, ten days\\' journey--200 miles--west of Fort Hall.] The buffalo then remained for many years in that country, and frequently moved down the valley of the Columbia, on both sides of the river, as far as the Fishing Falls. Below this point they never descended in any numbers. About 1834 or 1835 they began to diminish very rapidly, and continued to decrease until 1838 or 1840, when, with the country we have just described, they entirely abandoned all the waters of the Pacific north of Lewis\\'s Fork of the Columbia [now called Snake] River. At that time the Flathead Indians were in the habit of finding their buffalo on the heads of Salmon River and other streams of the Columbia. OREGON.--The only evidence on record of the occurrence of the bison in Oregon is the following, from Professor Allen\\'s memoir (p. 119): \"Respecting its former occurrence in eastern Oregon, Prof. O. C. Marsh, under date of New Haven, February 7, 1875, writes me as follows: \\'The most western point at which I have myself observed remains of the buffalo was in 187 on Willow Creek, eastern Oregon, among the foot hills of the eastern side of the Blue Mountains. This is about latitude 44°. The bones were perfectly characteristic, although nearly decomposed.\\'\" The remains must have been those of a solitary and very enterprising straggler. THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES (British).--At two or three points only did the buffaloes of the British Possessions cross the Rocky Mountain barrier toward British Columbia. One was the pass through which the Canadian Pacific Railway now runs, 200 miles north of the international boundary. According to Dr. Richardson, the number of buffaloes which crossed the mountains at that point were sufficiently noticeable to constitute a feature of the fauna on the western side of the range. It is said that buffaloes also crossed by way of the Kootenai Pass, which is only a few miles north of the boundary line, but the number which did so must have been very small. As might be expected from the character of the country, the favorite range of the bison in British America was the northern extension of the great pasture region lying between the Missouri River and Great Slave Lake. The most northerly occurrence of the bison is recorded as an observation of Franklin in 1820 at Slave Point, on the north side of Great Slave Lake. \"A few frequent Slave Point, on the north side of the lake, but this is the most northern situation in which they were observed by Captain Franklin\\'s party.\"[17] [Note 17: Sabine, Zoological Appendix to \"Franklin\\'s Journey,\" p. 668.] Dr. Richardson defined the eastern boundary of the bison\\'s range in British America as follows: \"They do not frequent any of the districts formed of primitive rocks, and the limits of their range to the eastward, within the Hudson\\'s Bay Company\\'s territories, may be correctly marked on the map by a line commencing in longitude 97°, on the Red River, which flows into the south end of Lake Winnipeg, crossing the Saskatchewan to the westward of the Basquian Hill, and running thence by the Athapescow to the east end of Great Slave Lake.\" Their migrations westward were formerly limited to the Rocky Mountain range, and they are still unknown in New Caledonia and on the shores of the Pacific to the north of the Columbia River; but of late years they have found out a passage across the mountains near the sources of the Saskatchewan, and their numbers to the westward are annually increasing.[18] [Note 18: Fauna Boreali-Americana, vol. 1, p, 279-280.] _Great Slave Lake._--That the buffalo inhabited the southern shore of this lake as late as 1871 is well established by the following letter from Mr. E. W. Nelson to Mr. J. A. Allen, under date of July 11, 1877:[19] \"I have met here [St. Michaels, Alaska] two gentlemen who crossed the mountains from British Columbia and came to Fort Yukon through British America, from whom I have derived some information about the buffalo (_Bison americanus_) which will be of interest to you. These gentlemen descended the Peace River, and on about the one hundred and eighteenth degree of longitude made a portage to Hay River, directly north. On this portage they saw thousands of buffalo skulls, and old trails, in some instances 2 or 3 feet deep, leading east and west. They wintered on Hay River near its entrance into Great Slave Lake, and here found the buffalo still common, occupying a restricted territory along the southern border of the lake. This was in 1871. They made inquiry concerning the large number of skulls seen by them on the portage, and learned that about fifty years before, snow fell to the estimated depth of 14 feet, and so enveloped the animals that they perished by thousands. It is asserted that these buffaloes are larger than those of the plains.\" [Note 19: American Naturalist, xi, p. 624.] MINNESOTA AND WISCONSIN.--A line drawn from Winnipeg to Chicago, curving slightly to the eastward in the middle portion, will very nearly define the eastern boundary of the buffalo\\'s range in Minnesota and Wisconsin. ILLINOIS AND INDIANA.--The whole of these two States were formerly inhabited by the buffalo, the fertile prairies of Illinois being particularly suited to their needs. It is doubtful whether the range of the species extended north of the northern boundary of Indiana, but since southern Michigan was as well adapted to their support as Ohio or Indiana, their absence from that State must have been due more to accident than design. OHIO.--The southern shore of Lake Erie forms part of the northern boundary of the bison\\'s range in the eastern United States. La Hontan explored Lake Erie in 1687 and thus describes its southern shore: \"I can not express what quantities of Deer and Turkeys are to be found in these Woods, and in the vast Meads that lye upon the South side of the Lake. At the bottom of the Lake we find beeves upon the Banks of two pleasant Rivers that disembogue into it, without Cataracts or Rapid Currents.\"[20] It thus appears that the southern shore of Lake Erie forms part of the northern boundary of the buffalo\\'s range in the eastern United States. [Note 20: J. A. Allen\\'s _American Bisons_, p. 107.] NEW YORK.--In regard to the presence of the bison in any portion of the State of New York, Professor Allen considers the evidence as fairly conclusive that it once existed in western New York, not only in the vicinity of the eastern end of Lake Erie, where now stands the city of Buffalo, at the mouth of a large creek of the same name, but also on the shore of Lake Ontario, probably in Orleans County. In his monograph of \"The American Bisons,\" page 107, he gives the following testimony and conclusions on this point: \"The occurrence of a stream in western New York, called Buffalo Creek, which empties into the eastern end of Lake Erie, is commonly viewed as traditional evidence of its occurrence at this point, but positive testimony to this effect has thus far escaped me. \"This locality, if it actually came so far eastward, must have formed the eastern limit of its range along the lakes. I have found only highly questionable allusions to the occurrence of buffaloes along the southern shore of Lake Ontario. Keating, on the authority of Colhoun, however, has cited a passage from Morton\\'s \"New English Canaan\" as proof of their former existence in the neighborhood of this lake. Morton\\'s statement is based on Indian reports, and the context gives sufficient evidence of the general vagueness of his knowledge of the region of which he was speaking. The passage, printed in 1637 is as follows: They [the Indians] have also made descriptions of great heards of well growne beasts that live about the parts of this lake [Erocoise] such as the Christian world (untill this discovery) hath not bin made acquainted with. These Beasts are of the bignesse of a Cowe, their flesh being very good foode, their hides good lether, their fleeces very usefull, being a kinde of wolle as fine almost as the wolle of the Beaver, and the Salvages doe make garments thereof. It is tenne yeares since first the relation of these things came to the eares of the English.\\' The \\'beast\\' to which allusion is here made [says Professor Allen] is unquestionably the buffalo, but the locality of Lake \\'Erocoise\\' is not so easily settled. Colhoun regards it, and probably correctly, as identical with Lake Ontario. * * * The extreme northeastern limit of the former range of the buffalo seems to have been, as above stated, in western New York, near the eastern end of Lake Erie. That it probably ranged thus far there is fair evidence.\" PENNSYLVANIA.--From the eastern end of Lake Erie the boundary of the bison\\'s habitat extends south into western Pennsylvania, to a marsh called Buffalo Swamp on a map published by Peter Kalm in 1771. Professor Allen says it \"is indicated as situated between the Alleghany River and the West Branch of the Susquehanna, near the heads of the Licking and Toby\\'s Creeks (apparently the streams now called Oil Creek and Clarion Creek).\" In this region there were at one time thousands of buffaloes. While there is not at hand any positive evidence that the buffalo ever inhabited the southwestern portion of Pennsylvania, its presence in the locality mentioned above, and in West Virginia generally, on the south, furnishes sufficient reason for extending the boundary so as to include the southwestern portion of the State and connect with our starting point, the District of Columbia. III. ABUNDANCE. Of all the quadrupeds that have lived upon the earth, probably no other species has ever marshaled such innumerable hosts as those of the American bison. It would have been as easy to count or to estimate the number of leaves in a forest as to calculate the number of buffaloes living at any given time during the history of the species previous to 1870. Even in South Central Africa, which has always been exceedingly prolific in great herds of game, it is probable that all its quadrupeds taken together on an equal area would never have more than equaled the total number of buffalo in this country forty years ago. To an African hunter, such a statement may seem incredible, but it appears to be fully warranted by the literature of both branches of the subject. Not only did the buffalo formerly range eastward far into the forest regions of western New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, but in some places it was so abundant as to cause remark. In Mr. J. A. Allen\\'s valuable monograph[21] appear a great number of interesting historical references on this subject, as indeed to every other relating to the buffalo, a few of which I will take the liberty of quoting. [Note 21: All who are especially interested in the life history of the buffalo, both scientific and economical, will do well to consult Mr. Allen\\'s monograph, \"The American Bisons, Living and Extinct,\" if it be accessible. Unfortunately it is a difficult matter for the general reader to obtain it. A reprint of the work as originally published, but omitting the map, plates, and such of the subject-matter as relates to the extinct species, appears in Hayden\\'s \"Report of the Geological Survey of the Territories,\" for 1875 (pp. 443-587), but the volume has for several years been out of print.

Unfortunately both are of greater rarity than the reprint referred to above.] In the vicinity of the spot where the town of Clarion now stands, in northwestern Pennsylvania, Mr. Thomas Ashe relates that one of the first settlers built his log cabin near a salt spring which was visited by buffaloes in such numbers that \"he supposed there could not have been less than two thousand in the neighborhood of the spring.\" During the first years of his residence there, the buffaloes came in droves of about three hundred each. Of the Blue Licks in Kentucky, Mr. John Filson thus wrote, in 1784: \"The amazing herds of buffaloes which resort thither, by their size and number, fill the traveller with amazement and terror, especially when he beholds the prodigious roads they have made from all quarters, as if leading to some populous city; the vast space of land around these springs desolated as if by a ravaging enemy, and hills reduced to plains; for the land near these springs is chiefly hilly. * * * I have heard a hunter assert he saw above one thousand buffaloes at the Blue Licks at once; so numerous were they before the first settlers had wantonly sported away their lives.\" Col. Daniel Boone declared of the Red River region in Kentucky, \"The buffaloes were more frequent than I have seen cattle in the settlements, browzing on the leaves of the cane, or cropping the herbage of those extensive plains, fearless because ignorant of the violence of man. Sometimes we saw hundreds in a drove, and the numbers about the salt springs were amazing.\" According to Ramsey, where Nashville now stands, in 1770 there were \"immense numbers of buffalo and other wild game. The country was crowded with them. Their bellowings sounded from the hills and forest.\" Daniel Boone found vast herds of buffalo grazing in the valleys of East Tennessee, between the spurs of the Cumberland mountains. Marquette declared that the prairies along the Illinois River were \"covered with buffaloes.\" Father Hennepin, in writing of northern Illinois, between Chicago and the Illinois River, asserted that \"there must be an innumerable quantity of wild bulls in that country, since the earth is covered with their horns. * * * They follow one another, so that you may see a drove of them for above a league together. * * * Their ways are as beaten as our great roads, and no herb grows therein.\" Judged by ordinary standards of comparison, the early pioneers of the last century thought buffalo were abundant in the localities mentioned above. But the herds which lived east of the Mississippi were comparatively only mere stragglers from the innumerable mass which covered the great western pasture region from the Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains, and from the Rio Grande to Great Slave Lake. The town of Kearney, in south central Nebraska, may fairly be considered the geographical center of distribution of the species, as it originally existed, but ever since 1800, and until a few years ago, the center of population has been in the Black Hills of southwestern Dakota. Between the Rocky Mountains and the States lying along the Mississippi River on the west, from Minnesota to Louisiana, the whole country was one vast buffalo range, inhabited by millions of buffaloes. One could fill a volume with the records of plainsmen and pioneers who penetrated or crossed that vast region between 1800 and 1870, and were in turn surprised, astounded, and frequently dismayed by the tens of thousands of buffaloes they observed, avoided, or escaped from. They lived and moved as no other quadrupeds ever have, in great multitudes, like grand armies in review, covering scores of square miles at once. They were so numerous they frequently stopped boats in the rivers, threatened to overwhelm travelers on the plains, and in later years derailed locomotives and cars, until railway engineers learned by experience the wisdom of stopping their trains whenever there were buffaloes crossing the track. On this feature of the buffalo\\'s life history a few detailed observations may be of value. Near the mouth of the White River, in southwestern Dakota, Lewis and Clark saw (in 1806) a herd of buffalo which caused them to make the following record in their journal: \"These last animals [buffaloes] are now so numerous that from an eminence we discovered more than we had ever seen before at one time; and if it be not impossible to calculate the moving multitude, which darkened the whole plains, we are convinced that twenty thousand would be no exaggerated number.\" When near the mouth of the Yellowstone, on their way down the Missouri, a previous record had been made of a meeting with other herds: \"The buffalo now appear in vast numbers. A herd happened to be on their way across the river [the Missouri]. Such was the multitude of these animals that although the river, including an island over which they passed, was a mile in length, the herd stretched as thick as they could swim completely from one side to the other, and the party was obliged to stop for an hour. They consoled themselves for the delay by killing four of the herd, and then proceeded till at the distance of 45 miles they halted on an island, below which two other herds of buffalo, as numerous as the first, soon after crossed the river.\"[22] [Note 22: Lewis and Clark\\'s Exped., II, p. 395.] Perhaps the most vivid picture ever afforded of the former abundance of buffalo is that given by Col. R. I. Dodge in his \"Plains of the Great West,\" p. 120, _et seq._ It is well worth reproducing entire: \"In May, 1871, I drove in a light wagon from Old Fort Zara to Fort Larned, on the Arkansas, 34 miles. At least 25 miles of this distance was through one immense herd, composed of countless smaller herds of buffalo then on their journey north. The road ran along the broad level \\'bottom,\\' or valley, of the river. * * * \"The whole country appeared one great mass of buffalo, moving slowly to the northward; and it was only when actually among them that it could be ascertained that the apparently solid mass was an agglomeration of innumerable small herds, of from fifty to two hundred animals, separated from the surrounding herds by greater or less space, but still separated. The herds in the valley sullenly got out of my way, and, turning, stared stupidly at me, sometimes at only a few yards\\' distance. When I had reached a point where the hills were no longer more than a mile from the road, the buffalo on the hills, seeing an unusual object in their rear, turned, stared an instant, then started at full speed directly towards me, stampeding and bringing with them the numberless herds through which they passed, and pouring down upon me all the herds, no longer separated, but one immense compact mass of plunging animals, mad with fright, and as irresistible as an avalanche. \"The situation was by no means pleasant. Reining up my horse (which was fortunately a quiet old beast that had been in at the death of many a buffalo, so that their wildest, maddest rush only caused him to cock his ears in wonder at their unnecessary excitement), I waited until the front of the mass was within 50 yards, when a few well-directed shots from my rifle split the herd, and sent it pouring off in two streams to my right and left. When all had passed me they stopped, apparently perfectly satisfied, though thousands were yet within reach of my rifle and many within less than 100 yards. Disdaining to fire again, I sent my servant to cut out the tongues of the fallen. This occurred so frequently within the next 10 miles, that when I arrived at Fort Larned I had twenty-six tongues in my wagon, representing the greatest number of buffalo that my conscience can reproach me for having murdered on any single day. I was not hunting, wanted no meat, and would not voluntarily have fired at these herds. I killed only in self-preservation and fired almost every shot from the wagon.\" At my request Colonel Dodge has kindly furnished me a careful estimate upon which to base a calculation of the number of buffaloes in that great herd, and the result is very interesting. In a private letter, dated September 21, 1887, he writes as follows: \"The great herd on the Arkansas through which I passed could not have averaged, _at rest_, over fifteen or twenty individuals to the acre, but was, from my own observation, not less than 25 miles wide, and from reports of hunters and others it was about five days in passing a given point, or not less than 50 miles deep. From the top of Pawnee Rock I could see from 6 to 10 miles in almost every direction. This whole vast space was covered with buffalo, looking at a distance like one compact mass, the visual angle not permitting the ground to be seen. I have seen such a sight a great number of times, but never on so large a scale. \"That was the last of the great herds.\" With these figures before us, it is not difficult to make a calculation that will be somewhere near the truth of the number of buffaloes actually seen in one day by Colonel Dodge on the Arkansas River during that memorable drive, and also of the number of head in the entire herd. According to his recorded observation, the herd extended along the river for a distance of 25 miles, which was in reality the width of the vast procession that was moving north, and back from the road as far as the eye could reach, on both sides. It is making a low estimate to consider the extent of the visible ground at 1 mile on either side. This gives a strip of country 2 miles wide by 25 long, or a total of 50 square miles covered with buffalo, averaging from fifteen to twenty to the acre.[23] Taking the lesser number, in order to be below the truth rather than above it, we find that the number actually seen on that day by Colonel Dodge was in the neighborhood of 480,000, not counting the additional number taken in at the view from the top of Pawnee Rock, which, if added, would easily bring the total up to a round half million! [Note 23: On the plains of Dakota, the Rev. Mr. Belcourt (Schoolcraft\\'s N. A. Indians, IV, p. 108) once counted two hundred and twenty-eight buffaloes, a part of a great herd, feeding on a single acre of ground. This of course was an unusual occurrence with buffaloes not stampeding, but practically at rest. It is quite possible also that the extent of the ground may have been underestimated.] If the advancing multitude had been at all points 50 miles in length (as it was known to have been in some places at least) by 25 miles in width, and still averaged fifteen head to the acre of ground, it would have contained the enormous number of 12,000,000 head. But, judging from the general principles governing such migrations, it is almost certain that the moving mass advanced in the shape of a wedge, which would make it necessary to deduct about two-third from the grand total, which would leave 4,000,000 as our estimate of the actual number of buffaloes in this great herd, which I believe is more likely to be below the truth than above it. No wonder that the men of the West of those days, both white and red, thought it would be impossible to exterminate such a mighty multitude. The Indians of some tribes believed that the buffaloes issued from the earth continually, and that the supply was necessarily inexhaustible. And yet, in four short years the southern herd was almost totally annihilated. With such a lesson before our eyes, confirmed in every detail by living testimony, who will dare to say that there will be an elk, moose, caribou, mountain sheep, mountain goat, antelope, or black-tail deer left alive in the United States in a wild state fifty years from this date, ay, or even twenty-five? Mr. William Blackmore contributes the following testimony to the abundance of buffalo in Kansas:[24] [Note 24: Plains of the Great West, p. xvi.] \"In the autumn of 1868, whilst crossing the plains on the Kansas Pacific Railroad, for a distance of upwards of 120 miles, between Ellsworth and Sheridan, we passed through an almost unbroken herd of buffalo. The plains were blackened with them, and more than once the train had to stop to allow unusually large herds to pass. * * * In 1872, whilst on a scout for about a hundred miles south of Fort Dodge to the Indian Territory, we were never out of sight of buffalo.\" Twenty years hence, when not even a bone or a buffalo-chip remains above ground throughout the West to mark the presence of the buffalo, it may be difficult for people to believe that these animals ever existed in such numbers as to constitute not only a serious annoyance, but very often a dangerous menace to wagon travel across the plains, and also to stop railway trains, and even throw them off the track. The like has probably never occurred before in any country, and most assuredly never will again, if the present rate of large game destruction all over the world can be taken as a foreshadowing of the future. In this connection the following additional testimony from Colonel Dodge (\"Plains of the Great West,\" p. 121) is of interest: \"The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad was then [in 1871-\\'72] in process of construction, and nowhere could the peculiarity of the buffalo of which I am speaking be better studied than from its trains. If a herd was on the north side of the track, it would stand stupidly gazing, and without a symptom of alarm, although the locomotive passed within a hundred yards. If on the south side of the track, even though at a distance of 1 or 2 miles from it, the passage of a train set the whole herd in the wildest commotion. At full speed, and utterly regardless of the consequences, it would make for the track on its line of retreat. If the train happened not to be in its path, it crossed the track and stopped satisfied. If the train was in its way, each individual buffalo went at it with the desperation of despair, plunging against or between locomotive and cars, just as its blind madness chanced to direct it. Numbers were killed, but numbers still pressed on, to stop and stare as soon as the obstacle had passed. After having trains thrown off the track twice in one week, conductors learned to have a very decided respect for the idiosyncrasies of the buffalo, and when there was a possibility of striking a herd \\'on the rampage\\' for the north side of the track, the train was slowed up and sometimes stopped entirely.\" The accompanying illustration, reproduced from the \"Plains of the Great West,\" by the kind permission of the author, is, in one sense, ocular proof that collisions between railway trains and vast herds of buffaloes were so numerous that they formed a proper subject for illustration. In regard to the stoppage of trains and derailment of locomotives by buffaloes, Colonel Dodge makes the following allusion in the private letter already referred to: \"There are at least a hundred reliable railroad men now employed on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad who were witnesses of, and sometimes sufferers from, the wild rushes of buffalo as described on page 121 of my book. I was at the time stationed at Fort Dodge, and I was personally cognizant of several of these \\'accidents.\\'\" [Illustration: SLAUGHTER OF BUFFALO ON THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD. Reproduced from \"The Plains of the Great West,\" by permission of the author, Col. R. I. Dodge.] The following, from the ever pleasing pen of Mr. Catlin, is of decided interest in this connection: \"In one instance, near the mouth of White River, we met the most immense herd crossing the Missouri River [in Dakota], and from an imprudence got our boat into imminent danger amongst them, from which we were highly delighted to make our escape. It was in the midst of the \\'running season,\\' and we had heard the \\'roaring\\' (as it is called) of the herd when we were several miles from them. When we came in sight, we were actually terrified at the immense numbers that were streaming down the green hills on one side of the river, and galloping up and over the bluffs on the other. The river was filled, and in parts blackened with their heads and horns, as they were swimming about, following up their objects, and making desperate battle whilst they were swimming. I deemed it imprudent for our canoe to be dodging amongst them, and ran it ashore for a few hours, where we laid, waiting for the opportunity of seeing the river clear, but we waited in vain. Their numbers, however, got somewhat diminished at last, and we pushed off, and successfully made our way amongst them. From the immense numbers that had passed the river at that place, they had torn down the prairie bank of 15 feet in height, so as to form a sort of road or landing place, where they all in succession clambered up. Many in their turmoil had been wafted below this landing, and unable to regain it against the swiftness of the current, had fastened themselves along in crowds, hugging close to the high bank under which they were standing. As we were drifting by these, and supposing ourselves out of danger, I drew up my rifle and shot one of them in the head, which tumbled into the water, and brought with him a hundred others, which plunged in, and in a moment were swimming about our canoe, and placing it in great danger. No attack was made upon us, and in the confusion the poor beasts knew not, perhaps, the enemy that was amongst them; but we were liable to be sunk by them, as they were furiously hooking and climbing on to each other. I rose in my canoe, and by my gestures and hallooing kept them from coming in contact with us until we were out of their reach.\"[25] [Note 25: Catlin\\'s North American Indians, II, p. 13.] IV. CHARACTER OF THE SPECIES. 1. _The buffaloes rank amongst ruminants._--With the American people, and through them all others, familiarity with the buffalo has bred contempt. The incredible numbers in which the animals of this species formerly existed made their slaughter an easy matter, so much so that the hunters and frontiersmen who accomplished their destruction have handed down to us a contemptuous opinion of the size, character, and general presence of our bison. And how could it be otherwise than that a man who could find it in his heart to murder a majestic bull bison for a hide worth only a dollar should form a one-dollar estimate of the grandest ruminant that ever trod the earth? Men who butcher African elephants for the sake of their ivory also entertain a similar estimate of their victims. With an acquaintance which includes fine living examples of all the larger ruminants of the world except the musk-ox and the European bison, I am sure that the American bison is the grandest of them all. His only rivals for the kingship are the Indian bison, or gaur (_Bos gaurus_), of Southern India, and the aurochs, or European bison, both of which really surpass him in height, if not in actual balk also. The aurochs is taller, and possesses a larger pelvis and heavier, stronger hindquarters, but his body is decidedly smaller in all its proportions, which gives him a lean and \"leggy\" look. The hair on the head, neck, and forequarters of the aurochs is not nearly so long or luxuriant as on the same parts of the American bison. This covering greatly magnifies the actual bulk of the latter animal. Clothe the aurochs with the wonderful pelage of our buffalo, give him the same enormous chest and body, and the result would be a magnificent bovine monster, who would indeed stand without a rival. But when first-class types of the two species are placed side by side it seems to me that _Bison americanus_ will easily rank his European rival. The gaur has no long hair upon any part of his body or head. What little hair he has is very short and thin, his hindquarters being almost naked. I have seen hundreds of these animals at short range, and have killed and skinned several very fine specimens, one of which stood 5 feet 10 inches in height at the shoulders. But, despite his larger bulk, his appearance is not nearly so striking and impressive as that of the male American bison. He seems like a huge ox running wild. The magnificent dark brown frontlet and beard of the buffalo, the shaggy coat of hair upon the neck, hump, and shoulders, terminating at the knees in a thick mass of luxuriant black locks, to say nothing of the dense coat of finer fur on the body and hindquarters, give to our species not only an apparent height equal to that of the gaur, but a grandeur and nobility of presence which are beyond all comparison amongst ruminants. The slightly larger bulk of the gaur is of little significance in a comparison of the two species; for if size alone is to turn the scale, we must admit that a 500-pound lioness, with no mane whatever, is a more majestic looking animal than a 450-pound lion, with a mane which has earned him his title of king of beasts. 2. _Change of form in captivity._--By a combination of unfortunate circumstances, the American bison is destined to go down to posterity shorn of the honor which is his due, and appreciated at only half his worth. The hunters who slew him were from the very beginning so absorbed in the scramble for spoils that they had no time to measure or weigh him, nor even to notice the majesty of his personal appearance on his native heath. In captivity he fails to develop as finely as in his wild state, and with the loss of his liberty he becomes a tame-looking animal. He gets fat and short-bodied, and the lack of vigorous and constant exercise prevents the development of bone and muscle which made the prairie animal what he was. From observations made upon buffaloes that have been reared in captivity, I am firmly convinced that confinement and semi-domestication are destined to effect striking changes in the form of _Bison americanus_. While this is to be expected to a certain extent with most large species, the changes promise to be most conspicuous in the buffalo. The most striking change is in the body between the hips and the shoulders. As before remarked, it becomes astonishingly short and rotund, and through liberal feeding and total lack of exercise the muscles of the shoulders and hindquarters, especially the latter, are but feebly developed. The most striking example of the change of form in the captive buffalo is the cow in the Central Park Menagerie, New York. Although this animal is fully adult, and has given birth to three fine calves, she is small, astonishingly short-bodied, and in comparison with the magnificently developed cows taken in 1886 by the writer in Montana, she seems almost like an animal of another species. Both the live buffaloes in the National Museum collection of living animals are developing the same shortness of body and lack of muscle, and when they attain their full growth will but poorly resemble the splendid proportions of the wild specimens in the Museum mounted group, each of which has been mounted from a most careful and elaborate series of post-mortem measurements. It may fairly be considered, however, that the specimens taken by the Smithsonian expedition were in every way more perfect representatives of the species than have been usually taken in times past, for the simple reason that on account of the muscle they had developed in the numerous chases they had survived, and the total absence of the fat which once formed such a prominent feature of the animal, they were of finer form, more active habit, and keener intelligence than buffaloes possessed when they were so numerous. Out of the millions which once composed the great northern herd, those represented the survival of the fittest, and their existence at that time was chiefly due to the keenness of their senses and their splendid muscular powers in speed and endurance. Under such conditions it is only natural that animals of the highest class should be developed. On the other hand, captivity reverses all these conditions, while yielding an equally abundant food supply. In no feature is the change from natural conditions to captivity more easily noticeable than in the eye. In the wild buffalo the eye is always deeply set, well protected by the edge of the bony orbit, and perfect in form and expression. The lids are firmly drawn around the ball, the opening is so small that the white portion of the eyeball is entirely covered, and the whole form and appearance of the organ is as shapely and as pleasing in expression as the eye of a deer. In the captive the various muscles which support and control the eyeball seem to relax and thicken, and the ball protrudes far beyond its normal plane, showing a circle of white all around the iris, and bulging out in a most unnatural way. I do not mean to assert that this is common in captive buffaloes generally, but I have observed it to be disagreeably conspicuous in many. Another change which takes place in the form of the captive buffalo is an arching of the back in the middle, which has a tendency to make the hump look lower at the shoulders and visibly alters the outline of the back. This tendency to \"hump up\" the back is very noticeable in domestic cattle and horses during rainy weather. While a buffalo on his native heath would seldom assume such an attitude of dejection and misery, in captivity, especially if it be anything like close confinement, it is often to be observed, and I fear will eventually become a permanent habit. Indeed, I think it may be confidently predicted that the time will come when naturalists who have never seen a wild buffalo will compare the specimens composing the National Museum group with the living representatives to be seen in captivity and assert that the former are exaggerations in both form and size. 3. _Mounted Specimens in Museums._--Of the \"stuffed\" specimens to be found in museums, all that I have ever seen outside of the National Museum and even those within that institution up to 1886, were \"stuffed\" in reality as well as in name. The skins that have been rammed full of straw or excelsior have lost from 8 to 12 inches in height at the shoulders, and the high and sharp hump of the male has become a huge, thick, rounded mass like the hump of a dromedary, and totally unlike the hump of a bison. It is impossible for any taxidermist to stuff a buffalo-skin with loose materials and produce a specimen which fitly represents the species. The proper height and form of the animal can be secured and retained only by the construction of a manikin, or statue, to carry the skin. In view of this fact, which surely must be apparent to even the most casual observer, it is to be earnestly hoped that here no one in authority will ever consent to mount or have mounted a valuable skin of a bison in any other way than over a properly constructed manikin. 4. _The Calf._--The breeding season of the buffalo is from the 1st of July to the 1st of October. The young cow does not breed until she is three years old, and although two calves are sometimes produced at a birth, one is the usual number. The calves are born in April, May, and June, and sometimes, though rarely, as late as the middle of August. The calf follows its mother until it is a year old, or even older. In May, 1886, the Smithsonian expedition captured a calf alive, which had been abandoned by its mother because it could not keep up with her. The little creature was apparently between two and three weeks old, and was therefore born about May 1. Unlike the young of nearly all other _Bovidæ_, the buffalo calf during the first months of its existence is clad with hair of a totally different color from that which covers him during the remainder of his life. His pelage is a luxuriant growth of rather long, wavy hair, of a uniform brownish-yellow or \"sandy\" color (cinnamon, or yellow ocher, with a shade of Indian yellow) all over the head, body, and tail, in striking contrast with the darker colors of the older animals. On the lower half of the leg it is lighter, shorter, and straight. On the shoulders and hump the hair is longer than on the other portions, being 11/2 inches in length, more wavy, and already arranges itself in the tufts, or small bunches, so characteristic in the adult animal. On the extremity of the muzzle, including the chin, the hair is very short, straight, and as light in color as the lower portions of the leg. Starting on the top of the nose, an inch behind the nostrils, and forming a division between the light yellowish muzzle and the more reddish hair on the remainder of the head, there is an irregular band of dark, straight hair, which extends down past the corner of the mouth to a point just back of the chin, where it unites. From the chin backward the dark band increases in breadth and intensity, and continues back half way to the angle of the jaw. At that point begins a sort of under mane of wavy, dark-brown hair, nearly 3 inches long, and extends back along the median line of the throat to a point between the fore legs, where it abruptly terminates. From the back of the head another streak of dark hair extends backward along the top of the neck, over the hump, and down to the lumbar region, where it fades out entirely. These two dark bands are in sharp contrast to the light sandy hair adjoining. The tail is densely haired. The tuft on the end is quite luxuriant, and shows a center of darker hair. The hair on the inside of the ear is dark, but that on the outside is sandy. The naked portion of the nose is light Vandyke-brown, with a pinkish tinge, and the edge of the eyelid the same. The iris is dark brown. The horn at three months is about 1 inch in length, and is a mere little black stub. In the male, the hump is clearly defined, but by no means so high in proportion as in the adult animal. The hump of the calf from which this description is drawn is of about the same relative angle and height as that of an adult cow buffalo. The specimen itself is well represented in the accompanying plate. The measurements of this specimen in the flesh were as follows: +---------------------------------------------------------+ | BISON AMERICANUS. (Male; four months old.) | +---------------------------------------------------------+ | (_No. 15503, National Museum collection._) | +---------------------------------------------------------+ | |Feet.|Inches.| |Height at shoulders | 2 | 8 | |Length, head and body to insertion of tail | 3 | 101/2 | |Depth of chest | 1 | 4 | |Depth of flank | | 10 | |Girth behind fore leg | 3 | 1/2 | |From base of horns around end of nose | 1 | 71/2 | |Length of tail vertebræ | | 7 | +---------------------------------------------------------+ The calves begin to shed their coat of red hair about the beginning of August. The first signs of the change, however, appear about a month earlier than that, in the darkening of the mane under the throat, and also on the top of the neck.[26] [Note 26: Our captive had, in some way, bruised the skin on his forehead, and in June all the hair came off the top of his head, leaving it quite bald. We kept the skin well greased with porpoise oil, and by the middle of July a fine coat of black hair had grown out all over the surface that had previously been bare.] By the 1st of August the red hair on the body begins to fall off in small patches, and the growth of fine, new, dark hair seems to actually crowd off the old. As is the case with the adult animals, the shortest hair is the first to be shed, but the change of coat takes place in about half the time that it occupies in the older animals. By the 1st of October the transformation is complete, and not even a patch of the old red hair remains upon the new suit of brown. This is far from being the case with the old bulls and cows, for even up to the last week in October we found them with an occasional patch of the old hair still clinging to the new, on the back or shoulders. Like most young animals, the calf of the buffalo is very easily tamed, especially if taken when only a few weeks old. The one captured in Montana by the writer, resisted at first as stoutly as it was able, by butting with its head, but after we had tied its legs together and carried it to camp, across a horse, it made up its mind to yield gracefully to the inevitable, and from that moment became perfectly docile. It very soon learned to drink milk in the most satisfactory manner, and adapted itself to its new surroundings quite as readily as any domestic calf would have done. Its only cry was a low-pitched, pig-like grunt through the nose, which was uttered only when hungry or thirsty. I have been told by old frontiersmen and buffalo-hunters that it used to be a common practice for a hunter who had captured a young calf to make it follow him by placing one of his fingers in its mouth, and allowing the calf to suck at it for a moment. Often a calf has been induced in this way to follow a horseman for miles, and eventually to join his camp outfit. It is said that the same result has been accomplished with calves by breathing a few times into their nostrils. In this connection Mr. Catlin\\'s observations on the habits of buffalo calves are most interesting. \"In pursuing a large herd of buffaloes at the season when their calves are but a few weeks old, I have often been exceedingly amused with the curious maneuvers of these shy little things. Amidst the thundering confusion of a throng of several hundreds or several thousands of these animals, there will be many of the calves that lose sight of their dams; and being left behind by the throng, and the swift-passing hunters, they endeavor to secrete themselves, when they are exceedingly put to it on a level prairie, where naught can be seen but the short grass of 6 or 8 inches in height, save an occasional bunch of wild sage a few inches higher, to which the poor affrighted things will run, and dropping on their knees, will push their noses under it and into the grass, where they will stand for hours, with their eyes shut, imagining themselves securely hid, whilst they are standing up quite straight upon their hind feet, and can easily be seen at several miles distance. It is a familiar amusement with us, accustomed to these scenes, to retreat back over the ground where we have just escorted the herd, and approach these little trembling things, which stubbornly maintain their positions, with their noses pushed under the grass and their eyes strained upon us, us we dismount from our horses and are passing around them. From this fixed position they are sure not to move until hands are laid upon them, and then for the shins of a novice we can extend our sympathy; or if he can preserve the skin on his bones from the furious buttings of its head, we know how to congratulate him on his signal success and good luck.

And I have often, in concurrence with a known custom of the country, held my hands over the eyes of the calf and breathed a few strong breaths into its nostrils, after which I have, with my hunting companions, rode several miles into our encampment with the little prisoner busily following the heels of my horse the whole way, as closely and as affectionately as its instinct would attach it to the company of its dam. \"This is one of the most extraordinary things that I have met with in the habits of this wild country, and although I had often heard of it, and felt unable exactly to believe it, I am now willing to bear testimony to the fact from the numerous instances which I have witnessed since I came into the country. During the time that I resided at this post [mouth of the Tetón River] in the spring of the year, on my way up the river, I assisted (in numerous hunts of the buffalo with the fur company\\'s men) in bringing in, in the above manner, several of these little prisoners, which sometimes followed for 5 or 6 miles close to our horse\\'s heels, and even into the fur company\\'s fort, and into the stable where our horses were led. In this way, before I left the headwaters of the Missouri, I think we had collected about a dozen, which Mr. Laidlaw was successfully raising with the aid of a good milch cow.\"[27] [Note 27: North American Indians, I, 255.] It must be remembered, however, that such cases as the above were exceptional, even with the very young calves, which alone exhibited the trait described. Such instances occurred only when buffaloes existed in such countless numbers that man\\'s presence and influence had not affected the character of the animal in the least. No such instances of innocent stupidity will ever be displayed again, even by the youngest calf. The war of extermination, and the struggle for life and security have instilled into the calf, even from its birth, a mortal fear of both men and horses, and the instinct to fly for life. The calf captured by our party was not able to run, but in the most absurd manner it butted our horses as soon as they came near enough, and when Private Moran attempted to lay hold of the little fellow it turned upon him, struck him in the stomach with its head, and sent him sprawling into the sage-brush. If it had only possessed the strength, it would have led us a lively chase. During 1886 four other buffalo calves were either killed or caught by the cowboys on the Missouri-Yellowstone divide, in the Dry Creek region. All of them ran the moment they discovered their enemies. Two were shot and killed. One was caught by a cowboy named Horace Brodhurst, ear marked, and turned loose. The fifth one was caught in September on the Porcupine Creek round-up. He was then about five months old, and being abundantly able to travel he showed a clean pair of heels. It took three fresh horses, one after another, to catch him, and his final capture was due to exhaustion, and not to the speed of any of his pursuers. The distance covered by the chase, from the point where his first pursuer started to where the third one finally lassoed him, was considered to be at least 15 miles. But the capture came to naught, for on the following day the calf died from overexertion and want of milk. Colonel Dodge states that the very young calves of a herd have to depend upon the old bulls for protection, and seldom in vain. The mothers abandon their offspring on slight provocation, and even none at all sometimes, if we may judge from the condition of the little waif that fell into our hands. Had its mother remained with it, or even in its neighborhood, we should at least have seen her, but she was nowhere within a radius of 5 miles at the time her calf was discovered. Nor did she return to look for it, as two of us proved by spending the night in the sage-brush at the very spot where the calf was taken. Colonel Dodge declares that \"the cow seems to possess scarcely a trace of maternal instinct, and, when frightened, will abandon and run away from her calf without the slightest hesitation. * * * When the calves are young they are always kept in the center of each small herd, while the bulls dispose themselves on the outside.\"[28] [Note 28: Plains of the Great West, pp. 124, 125.] Apparently the maternal instinct of the cow buffalo was easily mastered by fear. That it was often manifested, however, is proven by the following from Audubon and Bachman:[29] [Note 29: Quadrupeds of North America, vol. II, pp. 38, 39.] \"Buffalo calves are drowned from being unable to ascend the steep banks of the rivers across which they have just swam, as the cows cannot help them, although they stand near the bank, and will not leave them to their fate unless something alarms them. \"On one occasion Mr. Kipp, of the American Fur Company, caught eleven calves, their dams all the time standing near the top of the bank. Frequently, however, the cows leave the young to their fate, when most of them perish. In connection with this part of the subject, we may add that we were informed, when on the Upper Missouri River, that when the banks of that river were practicable for cows, and their calves could not follow them, they went down again, after having gained the top, and would remain by them until forced away by the cravings of hunger. When thus forced by the necessity of saving themselves to quit their young, they seldom, if ever, return to them. When a large herd of these wild animals are crossing a river, the calves or yearlings manage to get on the backs of the cows, and are thus conveyed safely over.\" 5. _The Yearling._--During the first five months of his life, the calf changes its coat completely, and becomes in appearance a totally different animal. By the time he is six months old he has taken on all the colors which distinguish him in after life, excepting that upon his fore quarters. The hair on the head has started out to attain the luxuriant length and density which is so conspicuous in the adult, and its general color is a rich dark brown, shading to black under the chin and throat. The fringe under the neck is long, straight, and black, and the under parts, the back of the fore arm, the outside of thigh, and the tail-tuft are all black. The color of the shoulder, the side, and upper part of the hind quarter is a peculiar smoky brown (\"broccoli brown\" of Ridgway), having in connection with the darker browns of the other parts a peculiar faded appearance, quite as if it were due to the bleaching power of the sun. On the fore quarters there is none of the bright straw color so characteristic of the adult animal. Along the top of the neck and shoulders, however, this color has at last begun to show faintly. The hair on the body is quite luxuriant, both in length and density, in both respects quite equaling, if not even surpassing, that of the finest adults. For example, the hair on the side of the mounted yearling in the Museum group has a length of 2 to 21/2 inches, while that on the same region of the adult bull, whose pelage is particularly fine, is recorded as being 2 inches only. The horn is a straight, conical spike from 4 to 6 inches long, according to age, and perfectly black. The legs are proportionally longer and larger in the joints than those of the full-grown animal. The countenance of the yearling is quite interesting. The sleepy, helpless, innocent expression of the very young calf has given place to a wide-awake, mischievous look, and he seems ready to break away and run at a second\\'s notice. The measurements of the yearling in the Museum group are as follows: +----------------------------------------------------------------+ |BISON AMERICANUS. (Male yearling, taken Oct. 31, 1886. Montana.)| +----------------------------------------------------------------+ | (_No. 15694, National Museum collection._) | +----------------------------------------------------------------+ | | Feet.| Inches. | |Height at shoulders | 3 | 5 | |Length, head and body to insertion of tail | 5 | | |Depth of chest | 1 | 11 | |Depth of flank | 1 | 1 | |Girth behind fore leg | 4 | 3 | |From base of horns around end of nose | 2 | 11/2 | |Length of tail vertebræ | | 10 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+ 6. _The Spike Bull._--In hunters\\' parlance, the male buffalo between the \"yearling\" age and four years is called a \"spike\" bull, in recognition of the fact that up to the latter period the horn is a spike, either perfectly straight, or with a curve near its base, and a straight point the rest of the way up. The curve of the horn is generally hidden in the hair, and the only part visible is the straight, terminal spike. Usually the spike points diverge from each other, but often they are parallel, and also perpendicular. In the fourth year, however, the points of the horns begin to curve inward toward each other, describing equal arcs of the same circle, as if they were going to meet over the top of the head. In the handsome young \"spike\" bull in the Museum group, the hair on the shoulders has begun to take on the length, the light color, and tufted appearance of the adult, beginning at the highest point of the hump and gradually spreading. Immediately back of this light patch the hair is long, but dark and woolly in appearance. The leg tufts have doubled in length, and reveal the character of the growth that may be finally expected. The beard has greatly lengthened, as also has the hair upon the bridge of the nose, the forehead, ears, jaws, and all other portions of the head except the cheeks. The \"spike\" period of a buffalo is a most interesting one. Like a seventeen-year-old boy, the young bull shows his youth in so many ways it is always conspicuous, and his countenance is so suggestive of a half-bearded youth it fixes the interest to a marked degree. He is active, alert, and suspicious, and when he makes up his mind to run the hunter may as well give up the chase. By a strange fatality, our spike bull appears to be the only one in any museum, or even in preserved existence, as far as can be ascertained. Out of the twenty-five buffaloes killed and preserved by the Smithsonian expedition, ten of which were adult bulls, this specimen was the only male between the yearling and the adult ages. An effort to procure another entire specimen of this age from Texas yielded only two spike heads. It is to be sincerely regretted that more specimens representing this very interesting period of the buffalo\\'s life have not been preserved, for it is now too late to procure wild specimens. The following are the post-mortem dimensions of our specimen: +---------------------------------------------------------------+ | BISON AMERICANUS. | +---------------------------------------------------------------+ |(\"Spike\" bull, two years old; taken October 14, 1886.

But the head is irresistible in its claims to precedence. [Illustration: SPIKE BULL. From the group in the National Museum. Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the publishers.] It must be observed at this point that in many respects this animal is an exceptionally fine one. In actual size of frame, and in quantity and quality of pelage, it is far superior to the average, even of wild buffaloes when they were most numerous and at their best.[30] In one respect, however, that of actual bulk, it is believed that this specimen may have often been surpassed. When buffaloes were numerous, and not required to do any great amount of running in order to exist, they were, in the autumn months, very fat. Audubon says: \"A large bison bull will generally weigh nearly 2,000 pounds, and a fat cow about 1,200 pounds. We weighed one of the bulls killed by our party, and found it to reach 1,727 pounds, although it had already lost a good deal of blood. This was an old bull, and not fat. It had probably weighed more at some previous period.\"[31] Our specimen when killed (by the writer, December 6, 1886) was in full vigor, superbly muscled, and well fed, but he carried not a single pound of fat. For years the never-ceasing race for life had utterly prevented the secretion of useless and cumbersome fat, and his \"subsistence\" had gone toward the development of useful muscle. Having no means by which to weigh him, we could only estimate his weight, in which I called for the advice of my cowboys, all of whom were more or less familiar with the weight of range cattle, and one I regarded as an expert. At first the estimated weight of the animal was fixed at 1,700 pounds, but with a constitutional fear of estimating over the truth, I afterward reduced it to 1,600 pounds. This I am now well convinced was an error, for I believe the first figure to have been nearer the truth. [Note 30: In testimony whereof the following extract from a letter written by General Stewart Van Vliet, on March 10, 1897, to Professor Baird, is of interest: \"MY DEAR PROFESSOR: On the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant I saw General Sheridan, and yesterday we called on your taxidermist and examined the buffalo bull he is setting up for the Museum. I don\\'t think I have ever seen a more splendid specimen in my life. General Sheridan and I have seen millions of buffalo on the plains in former times. I have killed hundreds, but I never killed a larger animal than the one in the possession of your taxidermist.\"] [Note 31: Quadrupeds of North America, vol. II, p. 44.] In mounting the skin of this animal, we endeavored by every means in our power, foremost of which were three different sets of measurements, taken from the dead animal, one set to check another, to reproduce him when mounted in exactly the same form he possessed in life--muscular, but not fat. The color of the body and hindquarters of a buffalo is very peculiar, and almost baffles intelligent description. Audubon calls it \"between a dark umber and liver-shining brown.\" I once saw a competent artist experiment with his oil-colors for a quarter of an hour before he finally struck the combination which exactly matched the side of our large bull. To my eyes, the color is a pale gray-brown or smoky gray. The range of individual variation is considerable, some being uniformly darker than the average type, and others lighter. While the under parts of most adults are dark brown or blackish brown, others are actually black. The hair on the body and hinder parts is fine, wavy on the outside, and woolly underneath, and very dense. Add to this the thickness of the skin itself, and the combination forms a covering that is almost impervious to cold. The entire fore quarter region, _e. g._, the shoulders, the hump, and the upper part of the neck, is covered with a luxuriant growth of pale yellow hair (Naples yellow + yellow ocher), which stands straight out in a dense mass, disposed in handsome tufts. The hair is somewhat woolly in its nature, and the ends are as even as if the whole mass had lately been gone over with shears and carefully clipped. This hair is 4 inches in length. As the living animal moved his head from side to side, the hair parted in great vertical furrows, so deep that the skin itself seemed almost in sight. As before remarked, to comb this hair would utterly destroy its naturalness, and it should never be done under any circumstances. Standing as it does between the darker hair of the body on one side and the almost black mass of the head on the other, this light area is rendered doubly striking and conspicuous by contrast. It not only covers the shoulders, but extends back upon the thorax, where it abruptly terminates on a line corresponding to the sixth rib. From the shoulder-joint downward, the color shades gradually into a dark brown until at the knee it becomes quite black. The huge fore-arm is lost in a thick mass of long, coarse, and rather straight hair 10 inches in length. This growth stops abruptly at the knee, but it hangs within 6 inches of the hoof. The front side of this mass is blackish brown, but it rapidly shades backward and downward into jet-black. The hair on the top of the head lies in a dense, matted mass, forming a perfect crown of rich brown (burnt sienna) locks, 16 inches in length, hanging over the eyes, almost enveloping both horns, and spreading back in rich, dark masses upon the light-colored neck. On the cheeks the hair is of the same blackish brown color, but comparatively short, and lies in beautiful waves. On the bridge of the nose the hair is about 6 inches in length and stands out in a thick, uniform, very curly mass, which always looks as if it had just been carefully combed. Immediately around the nose and mouth the hair is very short, straight and stiff, and lies close to the skin, which leaves the nostrils and lips fully exposed. The front part of the chin is similarly clad, and its form is perfectly flat, due to the habit of the animal in feeding upon the short, crisp buffalo grass, in the course of which the chin is pressed flat against the ground. The end of the muzzle is very massive, measuring 2 feet 2 inches in circumference just back of the nostrils. The hair of the chin-beard is coarse, perfectly straight, jet black, and 111/2 inches in length on our old bull. Occasionally a bull is met with who is a genuine Esau amongst his kind. I once saw a bull, of medium size but fully adult, whose hair was a wonder to behold. I have now in my possession a small lock of hair which I plucked from his forehead, and its length is 221/2 inches. His horns were entirely concealed by the immense mass of long hair that nature had piled upon his head, and his beard was as luxuriant as his frontlet. [Illustration: BULL BUFFALO IN NATIONAL MUSEUM GROUP. Drawn by Ernest E. Thompson.] The nostril opening is large and wide. The color of the hairless portions of the nose and mouth is shiny Vandyke brown and black, with a strong tinge of bluish-purple, but this latter tint is not noticeable save upon close examination, and the eyelid is the same. The iris is of an irregular pear-shaped outline, 1-5/16 inches in its longest diameter, very dark, reddish brown in color, with a black edging all around it. Ordinarily no portion of the white eyeball is visible, but the broad black band surrounding the iris, and a corner patch of white, is frequently shown by the turning of the eye. The tongue is bluish purple, as are the lips inside. The hoofs and horns are, in reality, jet black throughout, but the horn often has at the base a scaly, dead appearance on the outside, and as the wrinkles around the base increase with age and scale up and gather dirt, that part looks gray. The horns of bulls taken in their prime are smooth, glossy black, and even look as if they had been half polished with oil. As the bull increases in age, the outer layers of the horn begin to break off at the tip and pile up one upon another, until the horn has become a thick, blunt stub, with only the tip of what was once a neat and shapely point showing at the end. The bull is then known as a \"stub-horn,\" and his horns increase in roughness and unsightliness as he grows older. From long rubbing on the earth, the outer curve of each horn is gradually worn flat, which still further mars its symmetry. The horns serve as a fair index of the age of a bison. After he is three years old, the bison adds each year a ring around the base of his horns, the same as domestic cattle. If we may judge by this, the horn begins to break when the bison is about ten or eleven years old, and the stubbing process gradually continues during the rest of his life. Judging by the teeth, and also the oldest horns I have seen, I am of the opinion that the natural life time of the bison is about twenty-five years; certainly no less. +--------------------------------------------------------+ | BISON AMERICANUS. | | (Male, eleven years old. | | Taken December 6, 1866.

The hair on the shoulders has begun to take on the light straw-color, and has by this time attained a length which causes it to arrange itself in tufts, or locks. The body colors have grown darker, and reached their permanent tone. Of course the hair on the head has by no means attained its full length, and the head is not at all handsome. The horns are quite small, but the curve is well defined, and they distinctly mark the sex of the individual, even at the beginning of the third year. +------------------------------------------------------------+ | BISON AMERICANUS. | |(Young cow, in third year.

The hair on the lower joints of the leg is in turn lighter, being about the same shade as that on the loins. The fore-arm is concealed in a mass of almost black hair, which gradually shades lighter from the elbow upward and along the whole region of the humerus. On the shoulder itself the hair is pale yellow or straw-color (Naples yellow + yellow ocher), which extends down in a point toward the elbow. From the back of the head a conspicuous baud of curly, dark-brown hair extends back like a mane along the neck and to the top of the hump, beyond which it soon fades out. The hair on the head is everywhere a rich burnt-sienna brown, except around the corners of the mouth, where it shades into black. The horns of the cow bison are slender, but solid for about two-thirds of their length from the tip, ringed with age near their base, and quite black. Very often they are imperfect in shape, and out of every five pairs at least one is generally misshapen. Usually one horn is \"crumpled,\" _e. g._, dwarfed in length and unnaturally thickened at the base, and very often one horn is found to be merely an unsightly, misshapen stub. [Illustration: From a photograph. Engraved by Frederick Juengling. BULL BUFFALO. (REAR VIEW.) Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the publishers.] The udder of the cow bison is very small, as might be expected of an animal which must do a great deal of hard traveling, but the milk is said to be very rich. Some authorities declare that it requires the milk of two domestic cows to satisfy one buffalo calf, but this, I think, is an error. Our calf began in May to consume 6 quarts of domestic milk daily, which by June 10 had increased to 8, and up to July 10, 9 quarts was the utmost it could drink. By that time it began to eat grass, but the quantity of milk disposed of remained about the same. +---------------------------------------------------------------+ | BISON AMERICANUS. | |(Adult cow, eight years old.

While most Rocky Mountain hunters consider the bison of the mountains quite distinct from that of the plains, it must be remarked that no two authorities quite agree in regard to the distinguishing characters of the variety they recognize. Colonel Dodge states that \"His body is lighter, whilst his legs are shorter, but much thicker and stronger, than the plains animal, thus enabling him to perform feats of climbing and tumbling almost incredible in such a huge and unwieldy beast.\"[32] [Note 32: Plains of the Great West, p. 144.] The belief in the existence of a distinct mountain variety is quite common amongst hunters and frontiersmen all along the eastern slope the Rocky Mountains as far north as the Peace River. In this connection the following from Professor Henry Youle Hind[33] is of general interest: [Note 33: Red River, Assinniboine and Saskatchewan Expedition, II p. 104-105.] \"The existence of two kinds of buffalo is firmly believed by many hunters at Red River; they are stated to be the prairie buffalo and the buffalo of the woods. Many old hunters with whom I have conversed on this subject aver that the so-called wood buffalo is a distinct species, and although they are not able to offer scientific proofs, yet the difference in size, color, hair, and horns, are enumerated as the evidence upon which they base their statement. Men from their youth familiar with these animals in the great plains, and the varieties which are frequently met with in large herds, still cling to this opinion. The buffalo of the plains are not always of the dark and rich bright brown which forms their characteristic color. They are sometimes seen from white to almost black, and a gray buffalo is not at all uncommon. Buffalo emasculated by wolves are often found on the prairies, where they grow to an immense size; the skin of the buffalo ox is recognized by the shortness of the wool and by its large dimensions. The skin of the so-called wood buffalo is much larger than that of the common animal, the hair is very short, mane or hair about the neck short and soft, and altogether destitute of curl, which is the common feature in the hair or wool of the prairie animal. Two skins of the so-called wood buffalo, which I saw at Selkirk Settlement, bore a very close resemblance to the skin of the Lithuanian bison, judging from the specimens of that species which I have since had an opportunity of seeing in the British Museum. \"The wood buffalo is stated to be very scarce, and only found north of the Saskatchewan and on the flanks of the Rocky Mountains. It never ventures into the open plains. The prairie buffalo, on the contrary, generally avoids the woods in summer and keeps to the open country; but in winter they are frequently found in the woods of the Little Souris, Saskatchewan, the Touchwood Hills, and the aspen groves on the Qu\\'Appelle. There is no doubt that formerly the prairie buffalo ranged through open woods almost as much as he now does through the prairies.\" Mr. Harrison S. Young, an officer of the Hudson\\'s Bay Fur Company, stationed at Fort Edmonton, writes me as follows in a letter dated October 22, 1887: \"In our district of Athabasca, along the Salt River, there are still a few wood buffalo killed every year; but they are fast diminishing in numbers, and are also becoming very shy.\" In Prof. John Macoun\\'s \"Manitoba and the Great Northwest,\" page 342, there occurs the following reference to the wood buffalo: \"In the winter of 1870 the last buffalo were killed north of Peace River; but in 1875 about one thousand head were still in existence between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers, north of Little Slave Lake. These are called wood buffalo by the hunters, but diner only in size from those of the plain.\" In the absence of facts based on personal observations, I may be permitted to advance an opinion in regard to the wood buffalo. There is some reason for the belief that certain changes of form may have taken place in the buffaloes that have taken up a permanent residence in rugged and precipitous mountain regions. Indeed, it is hardly possible to understand how such a radical change in the habitat of an animal could fail, through successive generations, to effect certain changes in the animal itself. It seems to me that the changes which would take place in a band of plains buffaloes transferred to a permanent mountain habitat can be forecast with a marked degree of certainty. The changes that take place under such conditions in cattle, swine, and goats are well known, and similar causes would certainly produce similar results in the buffalo. The scantier feed of the mountains, and the great waste of vital energy called for in procuring it, would hardly produce a larger buffalo than the plains-fed animal, who acquires an abundance of daily food of the best quality with but little effort. We should expect to see the mountain buffalo smaller in body than the plains animal, with better leg development, and particularly with stronger hind quarters. The pelvis of the plains buffalo is surprisingly small and weak for so large an animal. Beyond question, constant mountain climbing is bound to develop a maximum of useful muscle and bone and a minimum of useless fat. If the loss of mane sustained by the African lions who live in bushy localities may be taken as an index, we should expect the bison of the mountains, especially the \"wood buffalo,\" to lose a great deal of his shaggy frontlet and mane on the bushes and trees which surrounded him. Therefore, we would naturally expect to find the hair on those parts shorter and in far less perfect condition than on the bison of the treeless prairies. By reason of the more shaded condition of his home, and the decided mitigation of the sun\\'s fierceness, we should also expect to see his entire pelage of a darker tone. That he would acquire a degree of agility and strength unknown in his relative of the plain is reasonably certain. In the course of many centuries the change in his form might become well defined, constant, and conspicuous; but at present there is apparently not the slightest ground for considering that the \"mountain buffalo\" or \"wood buffalo\" is entitled to rank even as a variety of _Bison americanus_. Colonel Dodge has recorded some very interesting information in regard to the \"mountain, or wood buffalo,\" which deserves to be quoted entire.[34] [Note 34: Plains of the Great West, p. 144-147.] \"In various portions of the Rocky Mountains, especially in the region of the parks, is found an animal which old mountaineers call the \\'bison.\\' This animal bears about the same relation to a plains buffalo as a sturdy mountain pony does to an American horse. His body is lighter, whilst his legs are shorter, but much thicker and stronger, than the plains animal, thus enabling him to perform feats of climbing and tumbling almost incredible in such a huge and apparently unwieldy beast. \"These animals are by no means plentiful, and are moreover excessively shy, inhabiting the deepest, darkest defiles, or the craggy, almost precipitous, sides of mountains inaccessible to any but the most practiced mountaineers. \"From the tops of the mountains which rim the parks the rains of ages have cut deep gorges, which plunge with brusque abruptness, but nevertheless with great regularity, hundreds or even thousands of feet to the valley below. Down the bottom of each such gorge a clear, cold stream of purest water, fertilizing a narrow belt of a few feet of alluvial, and giving birth and growth, to a dense jungle of spruce, quaking asp, and other mountain trees. One side of the gorge is generally a thick forest of pine, while the other side is a meadow-like park, covered with splendid grass. Such gorges are the favorite haunt of the mountain buffalo. Early in the morning he enjoys a bountiful breakfast of the rich nutritious grasses, quenches his thirst with the finest water, and, retiring just within the line of jungle, where, himself unseen, he can scan the open, he crouches himself in the long grass and reposes in comfort and security until appetite calls him to his dinner late in the evening. Unlike their plains relative, there is no stupid staring at an intruder. At the first symptom of danger they disappear like magic in the thicket, and never stop until far removed from even the apprehension of pursuit. I have many times come upon their fresh tracks, upon the beds from which they had first sprung in alarm, but I have never even seen one. \"I have wasted much time and a great deal of wind in vain endeavors to add one of these animals to my bag. My figure is no longer adapted to mountain climbing, and the possession of a bison\\'s head of my own killing is one of my blighted hopes. \"Several of my friends have been more fortunate, but I know of no sportsman who has bagged more than one.[35] [Note 35: Foot-note by William Blackmore: \"The author is in error here, as in a point of the Tarryall range of mountains, between Pike\\'s Peak and the South Park, in the autumn of 1871, two mountain buffaloes were killed in one afternoon. The skin of the finer was presented to Dr. Frank Buckland.\"] \"Old mountaineers and trappers have given me wonderful accounts of the number of these animals in all the mountain region \\'many years ago;\\' and I have been informed by them, that their present rarity is due to the great snow-storm of 1844-\\'45, of which I have already spoken as destroying the plains buffalo in the Laramie country. \"One of my friends, a most ardent and pertinacious sportsman, determined on the possession of a bison\\'s head, and, hiring a guide, plunged into the mountain wilds which separate the Middle from South Park. After several days fresh tracks were discovered. Turning their horses loose on a little gorge park, such as described, they started on foot on the trail; for all that day they toiled and scrambled with the utmost caution--now up, now down, through deep and narrow gorges and pine thickets, over bare and rocky crags, sleeping where night overtook them. Betimes next morning they pushed on the trail, and about 11 o\\'clock, when both were exhausted and well-nigh disheartened, their route was intercepted by a precipice. Looking over, they descried, on a projecting ledge several hundred feet below, a herd of about 20 bisons lying down. The ledge was about 300 feet at widest, by probably 1,000 feet long. Its inner boundary was the wall of rock on the top of which they stood; its outer appeared to be a sheer precipice of at least 200 feet. This ledge was connected with the slope of the mountain by a narrow neck. The wind being right, the hunters succeeded in reaching this neck unobserved. My friend selected a magnificent head, that of a fine bull, young but full grown, and both fired. At the report the bisons all ran to the far end of the ledge and plunged over. \"Terribly disappointed, the hunters ran to the spot, and found that they had gone down a declivity, not actually a precipice, but so steep that the hunters could not follow them. \"At the foot lay a bison. A long, a fatiguing detour brought them to the spot, and in the animal lying dead before him my friend recognized his bull--his first and last mountain buffalo. Hone but a true sportsman can appreciate his feelings. \"The remainder of the herd was never seen after the great plunge, down which it is doubtful if even a dog could have followed unharmed.\" In the issue of Forest and Stream of June 14, 1888, Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, in an article entitled \"The American Buffalo,\" relates a very interesting experience with buffaloes which were pronounced to be of the \"mountain\" variety, and his observations on the animals are well worth reproducing here. The animals (eight in number) were encountered on the northern slope of the Big Horn Mountains, in the autumn of 1877. \"We came upon them during a fearful blizzard of heavy hail, during which our animals could scarcely retain their feet. In fact, the packer\\'s mule absolutely lay down on the ground rather than risk being blown down the mountain side, and my own horse, totally unable to face such a violent blow and the pelting hail (the stones being as large as big marbles), positively stood stock-still, facing an old buffalo bull that was not more than 25 feet in front of me. * * * Strange to say, this fearful gust did not last more than ten minutes, when it stopped as suddenly as it had commenced, and I deliberately killed my old buffalo at one shot, just where he stood, and, separating two other bulls from the rest, charged them down a rugged ravine. They passed over this and into another one, but with less precipitous sides and no trees in the way, and when I was on top of the intervening ridge I noticed that the largest bull had halted in the bottom. Checking my horse, an excellent buffalo hunter, I fired down at him without dismounting. The ball merely barked his shoulder, and to my infinite surprise he turned and charged me up the hill. * * * Stepping to one side of my horse, with the charging and infuriated bull not 10 feet to my front, I fired upon him, and the heavy ball took him square in the chest, bringing him to his knees, with a gush of scarlet blood from his mouth and nostrils. * * * \"Upon examining the specimen, I found it to be an old bull, apparently smaller and very much blacker than the ones I had seen killed on the plains only a day or so before. Then I examined the first one I had shot, as well as others which were killed by the packer from the same bunch, and I came to the conclusion that they were typical representatives of the variety known as the \\'mountain buffalo,\\' a form much more active in movement, of slighter limbs, blacker, and far more dangerous to attack. My opinion in the premises remains unaltered to-day. In all this I may be mistaken, but it was also the opinion held by the old buffalo hunter who accompanied me, and who at once remarked when he saw them that they were \\'mountain buffalo,\\' and not the plains variety. * * * \"These specimens were not actually measured by me in either case, and their being considered smaller only rested upon my judging them by my eye. But they were of a softer pelage, black, lighter in limb, and when discovered were in the timber, on the side of the Big Horn Mountains.\" The band of bison in the Yellowstone Park must, of necessity, be of the so-called \"wood\" or \"mountain\" variety, and if by any chance one of its members ever dies of old age, it is to be hoped its skin may be carefully preserved and sent to the National Museum to throw some further light on this question. 11. _The shedding of the winter pelage._--In personal appearance the buffalo is subject to striking, and even painful, variations, and the estimate an observer forms of him is very apt to depend upon the time of the year at which the observation is made. Toward the end of the winter the whole coat has become faded and bleached by the action of the sun, wind, snow, and rain, until the freshness of its late autumn colors has totally disappeared. The bison takes on a seedy, weathered, and rusty look. But this is not a circumstance to what happens to him a little later. Promptly with the coming of the spring, if not even in the last week of February, the buffalo begins the shedding of his winter coat. It is a long and difficult task, and with commendable energy he sets about it at the earliest possible moment. It lasts him more than half the year, and is attended with many positive discomforts. The process of shedding is accomplished in two ways: by the new hair growing into and forcing off the old, and by the old hair falling off in great patches, leaving the skin bare. On the heavily-haired portions--the head, neck, fore quarters, and hump--the old hair stops growing, dies, and the new hair immediately starts through the skin and forces it off. The new hair grows so rapidly, and at the same time so densely, that it forces itself into the old, becomes hopelessly entangled with it, and in time actually lifts the old hair clear of the skin. On the head the new hair is dark brown or black, but on the neck, fore quarters, and hump it has at first, and indeed until it is 2 inches in length, a peculiar gray or drab color, mixed with brown, totally different from its final and natural color. The new hair starts first on the head, but the actual shedding of the old hair is to be seen first along the lower parts of the neck and between the fore legs. The heavily-haired parts are never bare, but, on the contrary, the amount of hair upon them is about the same all the year round. The old and the new hair cling together with provoking tenacity long after the old coat should fall, and on several of the bulls we killed in October there were patches of it still sticking tightly to the shoulders, from which it had to be forcibly plucked away. Under all such patches the new hair was of a different color from that around them. The other process of shedding takes place on the body and hind quarters, from which the old hair loosens and drops off in great woolly flakes a foot square, more or less. The shedding takes place very unevenly, the old hair remaining much longer in some places than in others. During April, May, and June the body and hind quarters present a most ludicrous and even pitiful spectacle. The island-like patches of persistent old hair alternating with patches of bare brown skin are adorned (?) by great ragged streamers of loose hair, which flutter in the wind like signals of distress. Whoever sees a bison at this period is filled with a desire to assist nature by plucking off the flying streamers of old hair; but the bison never permits anything of the kind, however good one\\'s intentions may be. All efforts to dislodge the old hair are resisted to the last extremity, and the buffalo generally acts as if the intention were to deprive him of his skin itself. By the end of June, if not before, the body and hind quarters are free from the old hair, and as bare as the hide of a hippopotamus. The naked skin has a shiny brown appearance, and of course the external anatomy of the animal is very distinctly revealed. But for the long hair on the fore quarters, neck, and head the bison would lose all his dignity of appearance with his hair. As it is, the handsome black head, which is black with new hair as early as the first of May, redeems the animal from utter homeliness. After the shedding of the body hair, the naked skin of the buffalo is burned by the sun and bitten by flies until he is compelled to seek a pool of water, or even a bed of soft mud, in which to roll and make himself comfortable. He wallows, not so much because he is so fond of either water or mud, but in self-defense; and when he emerges from his wallow, plastered with mud from head to tail, his degradation is complete. He is then simply not fit to be seen, even by his best friends. By the first of October, a complete and wonderful transformation has taken place. The buffalo stands forth clothed in a complete new suit of hair, fine, clean, sleek, and bright in color, not a speck of dirt nor a lock awry anywhere. To be sure, it is as yet a trifle short on the body, where it is not over an inch in length, and hardly that; but it is growing rapidly and getting ready for winter. From the 20th of November to the 20th of December the pelage is at its very finest. By the former date it has attained its full growth, its colors are at their brightest, and nothing has been lost either by the elements or by accidental causes. To him who sees an adult bull at this period, or near it, the grandeur of the animal is irresistibly felt. After seeing buffaloes of all ages in the spring and summer months the contrast afforded by those seen in October, November, and December was most striking and impressive. In the later period, as different individuals were wounded and brought to bay at close quarters, their hair was so clean and well-kept, that more than once I was led to exclaim: \"He looks as if he had just been combed.\" It must be remarked, however, that the long hair of the head and fore quarters is disposed in locks or tufts, and to comb it in reality would utterly destroy its natural and characteristic appearance. Inasmuch as the pelage of the domesticated bison, the only representatives of the species which will be found alive ten years hence, will in all likelihood develop differently from that of the wild animal, it may some time in the future be of interest to know the length, by careful measurement, of the hair found on carefully-selected typical wild specimens. To this end the following measurements are given. It must be borne in mind that these specimens were not chosen because their pelage was particularly luxuriant, but rather because they are fine average specimens. The hair of the adult bull is by no means as long as I have seen on a bison, although perhaps not many have greatly surpassed it. It is with the lower animals as with man--the length of the hairy covering is an individual character only. I have in my possession a tuft of hair, from the frontlet of a rather small bull bison, which measures 221/2 inches in length. The beard on the specimen from which this came was correspondingly long, and the entire pelage was of wonderful length and density. LENGTH OF THE HAIR OF BISON AMERICANUS.

I have met many old buffalo hunters, who had killed thousands and seen scores of thousands of buffaloes, yet never had seen a white one. From all accounts it appears that not over ten or eleven white buffaloes, or white buffalo skins, were ever seen by white men. Pied individuals were occasionally obtained, but even they were rare. Albino buffaloes were always so highly prized that not a single one, so far as I can learn, ever had the good fortune to attain adult size, their appearance being so striking, in contrast with the other members of the herd, as to draw upon them an unusual number of enemies, and cause their speedy destruction. At the New Orleans Exposition, in 1884-\\'85, the Territory of Dakota exhibited, amongst other Western quadrupeds, the mounted skin of a two-year-old buffalo which might fairly be called an albino. Although not really white, it was of a uniform dirty cream-color, and showed not a trace of the bison\\'s normal color on any part of its body. Lieut. Col. S. C. Kellogg, U. S. Army, has on deposit in the National Museum a tanned skin which is said to have come from a buffalo. It is from an animal about one year old, and the hair upon it, which is short, very curly or wavy, and rather coarse, is pure white. In length and texture the hair does not in any one respect resemble the hair of a yearling buffalo save in one particular,--along the median line of the neck and hump there is a rather long, thin mane of hair, which has the peculiar woolly appearance of genuine buffalo hair on those parts. On the shoulder portions of the skin the hair is as short as on the hind quarters. I am inclined to believe this rather remarkable specimen came from a wild half-breed calf, the result of a cross between a white domestic cow and a buffalo bull. At one time it was by no means uncommon for small bunches of domestic cattle to enter herds of buffalo and remain there permanently. I have been informed that the late General Marcy possessed a white buffalo skin. If it is still in existence, and is really _white_, it is to be hoped that so great a rarity may find a permanent abiding place in some museum where the remains of _Bison americanus_ are properly appreciated. V. THE HABITS OF THE BUFFALO. The history of the buffalo\\'s daily life and habits should begin with the \"running season.\" This period occupied the months of August and September, and was characterized by a degree of excitement and activity throughout the entire herd quite foreign to the ease-loving and even slothful nature which was so noticeable a feature of the bison\\'s character at all other times. The mating season occurred when the herd was on its summer range. The spring calves were from two to four months old. Through continued feasting on the new crop of buffalo-grass and bunch-grass--the most nutritious in the world, perhaps--every buffalo in the herd had grown round-sided, fat, and vigorous. The faded and weather-beaten suit of winter hair had by that time fallen off and given place to the new coat of dark gray and black, and, excepting for the shortness of his hair, the buffalo was in prime condition. During the \"running season,\" as it was called by the plainsmen, the whole nature of the herd was completely changed. Instead of being broken up into countless small groups and dispersed over a vast extent of territory, the herd came together in a dense and confused mass of many thousand individuals, so closely congregated as to actually blacken the face of the landscape. As if by a general and irresistible impulse, every straggler would be drawn to the common center, and for miles on every side of the great herd the country would be found entirely deserted. At this time the herd itself became a seething mass of activity and excitement. As usual under such conditions, the bulls were half the time chasing the cows, and fighting each other during the other half. These actual combats, which were always of short duration and over in a few seconds after the actual collision took place, were preceded by the usual threatening demonstrations, in which the bull lowers his head until his nose almost touches the ground, roars like a fog-horn until the earth seems to fairly tremble with the vibration, glares madly upon his adversary with half-white eyeballs, and with his forefeet paws up the dry earth and throws it upward in a great cloud of dust high above his back. At such times the mingled roaring--it can not truthfully be described as lowing or bellowing--of a number of huge bulls unite and form a great volume of sound like distant thunder, which has often been heard at a distance of from 1 to 3 miles. I have even been assured by old plainsmen that under favorable atmospheric conditions such sounds have been heard five miles. Notwithstanding the extreme frequency of combats between the bulls during this season, their results were nearly always harmless, thanks to the thickness of the hair and hide on the head and shoulders, and the strength of the neck. Under no conditions was there ever any such thing as the pairing off or mating of male and female buffaloes for any length of time. In the entire process of reproduction the bison\\'s habits were similar to those of domestic cattle. For years the opinion was held by many, in some cases based on misinterpreted observations, that in the herd the identity of each family was partially preserved, and that each old bull maintained an individual harem and group of progeny of his own. The observations of Colonel Dodge completely disprove this very interesting theory; for at best it was only a picturesque fancy, ascribing to the bison a degree of intelligence which he never possessed. At the close of the breeding season the herd quickly settles down to its normal condition. The mass gradually resolves itself into the numerous bands or herdlets of from twenty to a hundred individuals, so characteristic of bison on their feeding grounds, and these gradually scatter in search of the best grass until the herd covers many square miles of country. In his search for grass the buffalo displayed but little intelligence or power of original thought. Instead of closely following the divides between water courses where the soil was best and grass most abundant, he would not hesitate to wander away from good feeding-grounds into barren \"bad lands,\" covered with sage-brush, where the grass was very thin and very poor. In such broken country as Montana, Wyoming, and southwestern Dakota, the herds, on reaching the best grazing grounds on the divides, would graze there day after day until increasing thirst compelled them to seek for water. Then, actuated by a common impulse, the search for a water-hole was begun in a business-like way. The leader of a herd, or \"bunch,\" which post was usually filled by an old cow, would start off down the nearest \"draw,\" or stream-heading, and all the rest would fall into line and follow her. From the moment this start was made there was no more feeding, save as a mouthful of grass could be snatched now and then without turning aside. In single file, in a line sometimes half a mile long and containing between one and two hundred buffaloes, the procession slowly marched down the coulée, close alongside the gully as soon as the water-course began to cut a pathway for itself. When the gully curved to right or left the leader would cross its bed and keep straight on until the narrow ditch completed its wayward curve and came back to the middle of the coulée. The trail of a herd in search of water is usually as good a piece of engineering as could be executed by the best railway surveyor, and is governed by precisely the same principles. It always follows the level of the valley, swerves around the high points, and crosses the stream repeatedly in order to avoid climbing up from the level. The same trail is used again and again by different herds until the narrow path, not over a foot in width, is gradually cut straight down into the soil to a depth of several inches, as if it had been done by a 12-inch grooving-plane. By the time the trail has been worn down to a depth of 6 or 7 inches, without having its width increased in the least, it is no longer a pleasant path to walk in, being too much like a narrow ditch. Then the buffaloes abandon it and strike out a new one alongside, which is used until it also is worn down and abandoned. To day the old buffalo trails are conspicuous among the very few classes of objects which remain as a reminder of a vanished race. The herds of cattle now follow them in single file just as the buffaloes did a few years ago, as they search for water in the same way. In some parts of the West, in certain situations, old buffalo trails exist which the wild herds wore down to a depth of 2 feet or more. Mile after mile marched the herd, straight down-stream, bound for the upper water-hole. As the hot summer drew on, the pools would dry up one by one, those nearest the source being the first to disappear. Toward the latter part of summer, the journey for water was often a long one. Hole after hole would be passed without finding a drop of water. At last a hole of mud would be found, below that a hole with a little muddy water, and a mile farther on the leader would arrive at a shallow pool under the edge of a \"cut bank,\" a white, snow-like deposit of alkali on the sand encircling its margin, and incrusting the blades of grass and rushed that grew up from the bottom. The damp earth around the pool was cut up by a thousand hoof-prints, and the water was warm, strongly impregnated with alkali, and yellow with animal impurities, but it was _water_. The nauseous mixture was quickly surrounded by a throng of thirsty, heated, and eager buffaloes of all ages, to which the oldest and strongest asserted claims of priority. There was much crowding and some fighting, but eventually all were satisfied. After such a long journey to water, a herd would usually remain by it for some hours, lying down, resting, and drinking at intervals until completely satisfied. Having drunk its fill, the herd would never march directly back to the choice feeding grounds it had just left, but instead would leisurely stroll off at a right angle from the course it came, cropping for awhile the rich bunch grasses of the bottom-lands, and then wander across the hills in an almost aimless search for fresh fields and pastures new. When buffaloes remained long in a certain locality it was a common thing for them to visit the same watering-place a number of times, at intervals of greater or less duration, according to circumstances. When undisturbed on his chosen range, the bison used to be fond of lying down for an hour or two in the middle of the day, particularly when fine weather and good grass combined to encourage him in luxurious habits. I once discovered with the field glass a small herd of buffaloes lying down at midday on the slope of a high ridge, and having ridden hard for several hours we seized the opportunity to unsaddle and give our horses an hour\\'s rest before making the attack. While we were so doing, the herd got up, shifted its position to the opposite side of the ridge, and again laid down, every buffalo with his nose pointing to windward. Old hunters declare that in the days of their abundance, when feeding on their ranges in fancied security, the younger animals were as playful as well-fed domestic calves. It was a common thing to see them cavort and frisk around with about as much grace as young elephants, prancing and running to and fro with tails held high in air \"like scorpions.\" Buffaloes are very fond of rolling in dry dirt or even in mud, and this habit is quite strong in captive animals. Not only is it indulged in during the shedding season, but all through the fall and winter. The two live buffaloes in the National Museum are so much given to rolling, even in rainy weather, that it is necessary to card them every few days to keep them presentable. Bulls are much more given to rolling than the cows, especially after they have reached maturity. They stretch out at full length, rub their heads violently to and fro on the ground, in which the horn serves as the chief point of contact and slides over the ground like a sled-runner. After thoroughly scratching one side on mother earth they roll over and treat the other in like manner. Notwithstanding his sharp and lofty hump, a buffalo bull can roll completely over with as much ease as any horse. The vast amount of rolling and side-scratching on the earth indulged in by bull buffaloes is shown in the worn condition of the horns of every old specimen. Often a thickness of half an inch is gone from the upper half of each horn on its outside curve, at which point the horn is worn quite flat. This is well illustrated in the horns shown in the accompanying plate, fig. 6. [Illustration: DEVELOPMENT OF THE HORNS OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 1. The Calf. 2. The Yearling. 3. Spike Bull, 2 years old. 4. Spike Bull, 3 years old. 5. Bull, 4 years old. 6. Bull, 11 years old. 7. Old \"stub-horn\" Bull, 20 years old.] Mr. Catlin[36] affords some very interesting and valuable information in regard to the bison\\'s propensity for wollowing in mad, and also the origin of the \"fairy circles,\" which have caused so much speculation amongst travelers: [Note 36: North American Indians, vol. I, p. 249, 250.] \"In the heat of summer, these huge animals, which no doubt suffer very much with the great profusion of their long and shaggy hair, or fur, often graze on the low grounds of the prairies, where there is a little stagnant water lying amongst the grass, and the ground underneath being saturated with it, is soft, into which the enormous bull, lowered down upon one knee, will plunge his horns, and at last his head, driving up the earth, and soon making an excavation in the ground into which the water filters from amongst the grass, forming for him in a few moments a cool and comfortable bath, into which he plunges like a hog in his mire. \"In this delectable laver he throws himself flat upon his side, and forcing himself violently around, with his horns and his huge hump on his shoulders presented to the sides, he ploughs up the ground by his rotary motion, sinking himself deeper and deeper in the ground, continually enlarging his pool, in which he at length becomes nearly immersed, and the water and mud about him mixed into a complete mortar, which changes his color and drips in streams from every part of him as he rises up upon his feet, a hideous monster of mud and ugliness, too frightful and too eccentric to be described! \"It is generally the leader of the herd that takes upon him to make this excavation, and if not (but another one opens the ground), the leader (who is conqueror) marches forward, and driving the other from it plunges himself into it; and, having cooled his sides and changed his color to a walking mass of mud and mortar, he stands in the pool until inclination induces him to step out and give place to the next in command who stands ready, and another, and another, who advance forward in their turns to enjoy the luxury of the wallow, until the whole band (sometimes a hundred or more) will pass through it in turn,[37] each one throwing his body around in a similar manner and each one adding a little to the dimensions of the pool, while he carries away in his hair an equal share of the clay, which dries to a gray or whitish color and gradually falls off. By this operation, which is done perhaps in the space of half an hour, a circular excavation of fifteen or twenty feet in diameter and two feet in depth is completed and left for the water to run into, which soon fills it to the level of the ground. [Note 37: In the District of Columbia work-house we have a counterpart of this in the public bath-tub, wherein forty prisoners were seen by a _Star_ reporter to bathe one after another in the same water!] \"To these sinks, the waters lying on the surface of the prairies are continually draining and in them lodging their vegetable deposits, which after a lapse of years fill them up to the surface with a rich soil, which throws up an unusual growth of grass and herbage, forming conspicuous circles, which arrest the eye of the traveler and are calculated to excite his surprise for ages to come.\" During the latter part of the last century, when the bison inhabited Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the salt springs of those States were resorted to by thousands of those animals, who drank of the saline waters and licked the impregnated earth. Mr. Thomas Ashe[38] affords us a most interesting account, from the testimony of an eye witness, of the behavior of a bison at a salt spring. The description refers to a locality in western Pennsylvania, where \"an old man, one of the first settlers of this country, built his log house on the immediate borders of a salt spring. He informed me that for the first several seasons the buffaloes paid him their visits with the utmost regularity; they traveled in single files, always following each other at equal distances, forming droves, on their arrival, of about 300 each. [Note 38: Travels in America in 1806. London, 1808.] \"The first and second years, so unacquainted were these poor brutes with the use of this man\\'s house or with his nature, that in a few hours they _rubbed_ the house completely down, taking delight in turning the logs off with their horns, while he had some difficulty to escape from being trampled under their feet or crushed to death in his own ruins. At that period he supposed there could not have been less than 2,000 in the neighborhood of the spring. They sought for no manner of food, but only bathed and drank three or four times a day and rolled in the earth, or reposed with their flanks distended in the adjacent shades; and on the fifth and sixth days separated into distinct droves, bathed, drank, and departed in single files, according to the exact order of their arrival. They all rolled successively in the same hole, and each thus carried away a coat of mud to preserve the moisture on their skin and which, when hardened and baked in the sun, would resist the stings of millions of insects that otherwise would persecute these peaceful travelers to madness or even death.\" It was a fixed habit with the great buffalo herds to move southward from 200 to 400 miles at the approach of winter. Sometimes this movement was accomplished quietly and without any excitement, but at other times it was done with a rush, in which considerable distances would be gone over on the double quick. The advance of a herd was often very much like that of a big army, in a straggling line, from four to ten animals abreast. Sometimes the herd moved forward in a dense mass, and in consequence often came to grief in quicksands, alkali bogs, muddy crossings, and on treacherous ice. In such places thousands of buffaloes lost their lives, through those in the lead being forced into danger by pressure of the mass coming behind. In this manner, in the summer of 1867, over two thousand buffaloes, out of a herd of about four thousand, lost their lives in the quicksands of the Platte River, near Plum Creek, while attempting to cross. One winter, a herd of nearly a hundred buffaloes attempted to cross a lake called Lac-qui-parle, in Minnesota, upon the ice, which gave way, and drowned the entire herd. During the days of the buffalo it was a common thing for voyagers on the Missouri River to see buffaloes hopelessly mired in the quicksands or mud along the shore, either dead or dying, and to find their dead bodies floating down the river, or lodged on the upper ends of the islands and sand-bars. Such accidents as these: it may be repeated, were due to the great number of animals and the momentum of the moving mass. The forced marches of the great herds were like the flight of a routed army, in which helpless individuals were thrust into mortal peril by the irresistible force of the mass coming behind, which rushes blindly on after their leaders. In this way it was possible to decoy a herd toward a precipice and cause it to plunge over en masse, the leaders being thrust over by their followers, and all the rest following of their own free will, like the sheep who cheerfully leaped, one after another, through a hole in the side of a high bridge because their bell-wether did so. But it is not to be understood that the movement of a great herd, because it was made on a run, necessarily partook of the nature of a stampede in which a herd sweeps forward in a body. The most graphic account that I ever obtained of facts bearing on this point was furnished by Mr. James McNaney, drawn from his experience on the northern buffalo range in 1882. His party reached the range (on Beaver Creek, about 100 miles south of Glendive) about the middle of November, and found buffaloes already there; in fact they had begun to arrive from the north as early as the middle of October. About the first of December an immense herd arrived from the north. It reached their vicinity one night, about 10 o\\'clock, in a mass that seemed to spread everywhere. As the hunters sat in their tents, loading cartridges and cleaning their rifles, a low rumble was heard, which gradually increased to \"a thundering noise,\" and some one exclaimed, \"There! that\\'s a big herd of buffalo coming in!\" All ran out immediately, and hallooed and discharged rifles to keep the buffaloes from running over their tents. Fortunately, the horses were picketed some distance away in a grassy coulée, which the buffaloes did not enter. The herd came at a jog trot, and moved quite rapidly. \"In the morning the whole country was black with buffalo.\" It was estimated that 10,000 head were in sight. One immense detachment went down on to a \"flat\" and laid down. There it remained quietly, enjoying a long rest, for about ten days. It gradually broke up into small bands, which strolled off in various directions looking for food, and which the hunters quietly attacked. A still more striking event occurred about Christmas time at the same place. For a few days the neighborhood of McNaney\\'s camp had been entirely deserted by buffaloes, not even one remaining. But one morning about daybreak a great herd which was traveling south began to pass their camp. A long line of moving forms was seen advancing rapidly from the northwest, coming in the direction of the hunters\\' camp. It disappeared in the creek valley for a few moments, and presently the leaders suddenly came in sight again at the top of \"a rise\" a few hundred yards away, and came down the intervening slope at full speed, within 50 yards of the two tents. After them came a living stream of followers, all going at a gallop, described by the observer as \"a long lope,\" from four to ten buffaloes abreast. Sometimes there would be a break in the column of a minute\\'s duration, then more buffaloes would appear at the brow of the hill, and the column went rushing by as before. The calves ran with their mothers, and the young stock got over the ground with much less exertion than the older animals. For about four hours, or until past 11 o\\'clock, did this column of buffaloes gallop past the camp over a course no wider than a village street. Three miles away toward the south the long dark line of bobbing humps and hind quarters wound to the right between two hills and disappeared. True to their instincts, the hunters promptly brought out their rifles, and began to fire at the buffaloes as they ran. A furious fusilade was kept up from the very doors of the tents, and from first to last over fifty buffaloes were killed. Some fell headlong the instant they were hit, but the greater number ran on until their mortal wounds compelled them to halt, draw off a little way to one side, and finally fall in their death struggles. Mr. McNaney stated that the hunters estimated the number of buffaloes _on that portion_ of the range that winter (1881-\\'82) at 100,000. It is probable, and in fact reasonably certain, that such forced-march migrations as the above were due to snow-covered pastures and a scarcity of food on the more northern ranges. Having learned that a journey south will bring him to regions of less snow and more grass, it is but natural that so lusty a traveler should migrate. The herds or bands which started south in the fall months traveled more leisurely, with frequent halts to graze on rich pastures. The advance was on a very different plan, taking place in straggling lines and small groups dispersed over quite a scope of country. Unless closely pursued, the buffalo never chose to make a journey of several miles through hilly country on a continuous run. Even when fleeing from the attack of a hunter, I have often had occasion to notice that, if the hunter was a mile behind, the buffalo would always walk when going uphill; but as soon as the crest was gained he would begin to run, and go down the slope either at a gallop or a swift trot. In former times, when the buffalo\\'s world was wide, when retreating from an attack he always ran against the wind, to avoid running upon a new danger, which showed that he depended more upon his sense of smell than his eye-sight. During the last years of his existence, however, this habit almost totally disappeared, and the harried survivors learned to run for the regions which offered the greatest safety. But even to-day, if a Texas hunter should go into the Staked Plains, and descry in the distance a body of animals running against the wind, he would, without a moment\\'s hesitation, pronounce them buffaloes, and the chances are that he would be right. In winter the buffalo used to face the storms, instead of turning tail and \"drifting\" before them helplessly, as domestic cattle do. But at the same time, when beset by a blizzard, he would wisely seek shelter from it in some narrow and deep valley or system of ravines. There the herd would lie down and wait patiently for the storm to cease. After a heavy fall of snow, the place to find the buffalo was in the flats and creek bottoms, where the tall, rank bunch-grasses showed their tops above the snow, and afforded the best and almost the only food obtainable. When the snow-fall was unusually heavy, and lay for a long time on the ground, the buffalo was forced to fast for days together, and sometimes even weeks. If a warm day came, and thawed the upper surface of the snow sufficiently for succeeding cold to freeze it into a crust, the outlook for the bison began to be serious. A man can travel over a crust through which the hoofs of a ponderous bison cut like chisels and leave him floundering belly-deep. It was at such times that the Indians hunted him on snow-shoes, and drove their spears into his vitals as he wallowed helplessly in the drifts. Then the wolves grew fat upon the victims which they, also, slaughtered almost without effort. Although buffaloes did not often actually perish from hunger and cold during the severest winters (save in a few very exceptional cases), they often came out in very poor condition. The old bulls always suffered more severely than the rest, and at the end of winter were frequently in miserable plight. Unlike most other terrestrial quadrupeds of America, so long as he could roam at will the buffalo had settled migratory habits.[39] While the elk and black-tail deer change their altitude twice a year, in conformity with the approach and disappearance of winter, the buffalo makes a radical change of latitude. This was most noticeable in the great western pasture region, where the herds were most numerous and their movements most easily observed. [Note 39: On page 248 of his \"North American Indians,\" vol. I, Mr. Catlin declares pointedly that \"these animals are, truly speaking, gregarious, but not migratory; they graze in immense and almost incredible numbers at times, and roam about and over vast tracts of country from east to west and from west to east as often as from north to south, which has often been supposed they naturally and habitually did to accommodate themselves to the temperature of the climate in the different latitudes.\" Had Mr. Catlin resided continuously in any one locality on the great buffalo range, he would have found that the buffalo had decided migratory habits. The abundance of proof on this point renders it unnecessary to eater fully into the details of the subject.] At the approach of winter the whole great system of herds which ranged from the Peace River to the Indian Territory moved south a few hundred miles, and wintered under more favorable circumstances than each band would have experienced at its farthest north. Thus it happened that nearly the whole of the great range south of the Saskatchewan was occupied by buffaloes even in winter. The movement north began with the return of mild weather in the early spring. Undoubtedly this northward migration was to escape the heat of their southern winter range rather than to find better pasture; for as a grazing country for cattle all the year round, Texas is hardly surpassed, except where it is overstocked. It was with the buffaloes a matter of choice rather than necessity which sent them on their annual pilgrimage northward. Col. R. I. Dodge, who has made many valuable observations on the migratory habits of the southern buffaloes, has recorded the following:[40] \"Early in spring, as soon as the dry and apparently desert prairie had begun to change its coat of dingy brown to one of palest green, the horizon would begin to be dotted with buffalo, single or in groups of two or three, forerunners of the coming herd. Thicker and thicker and in larger groups they come, until by the time the grass is well up the whole vast landscape appears a mass of buffalo, some individuals feeding, others standing, others lying down, but the herd moving slowly, moving constantly to the northward. * * * Some years, as in 1871, the buffalo appeared to move northward in one immense column oftentimes from 20 to 50 miles in width, and of unknown depth from front to rear. Other years the northward journey was made in several parallel columns, moving at the same rate, and with their numerous flankers covering a width of a hundred or more miles. \"The line of march of this great spring migration was not always the same, though it was confined within certain limits. I am informed by old frontiersmen that it has not within twenty-five years crossed the Arkansas River east of Great Bend nor west of Big Sand Creek. The most favored routes crossed the Arkansas at the mouth of Walnut Creek, Pawnee Fork, Mulberry Creek, the Cimarron Crossing, and Big Sand Creek. \"As the great herd proceeds northward it is constantly depleted, numbers wandering off to the right and left, until finally it is scattered in small herds far and wide over the vast feeding grounds, where they pass the summer. \"When the food in one locality fails they go to another, and towards fall, when the grass of the high prairie becomes parched by the heat and drought, they gradually work their way back to the south, concentrating on the rich pastures of Texas and the Indian Territory, whence, the same instinct acting on all, they are ready to start together on the northward march as soon as spring starts the grass.\" [Note 40: Our Wild Indians, p. 283, _et seq._] So long as the bison held undisputed possession of the great plains his migratory habits were as above--regular, general, and on a scale that was truly grand. The herds that wintered in Texas, the Indian Territory, and New Mexico probably spent their summers in Nebraska, southwestern Dakota, and Wyoming. The winter herds of northern Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, and southern Dakota went to northern Dakota and Montana, while the great Montana herds spent the summer on the Grand Coteau des Prairies lying between the Saskatchewan and the Missouri. The two great annual expeditions of the Red River half-breeds, which always took place in summer, went in two directions from Winnipeg and Pembina--one, the White Horse Plain division, going westward along the Qu\\'Appelle to the Saskatchewan country, and the other, the Red River division, southwest into Dakota. In 1840 the site of the present city of Jamestown, Dakota, was the northeastern limit of the herds that summered in Dakota, and the country lying between that point and the Missouri was for years the favorite hunting ground of the Red River division. The herds which wintered on the Montana ranges always went north in the early spring, usually in March, so that during the time the hunters were hauling in the hides taken on the winter hunt the ranges were entirely deserted. It is equally certain, however, that a few small bauds remained in certain portions of Montana throughout the summer. But the main body crossed the international boundary, and spent the summer on the plains of the Saskatchewan, where they were hunted by the half-breeds from the Red River settlements and the Indians of the plains. It is my belief that in this movement nearly all the buffaloes of Montana and Dakota participated, and that the herds which spent the summer in Dakota, where they were annually hunted by the Red River half-breeds, came up from Kansas, Colorado, and Nebraska. While most of the calves were born on the summer ranges, many were brought forth en route. It was the habit of the cows to retire to a secluded spot, if possible a ravine well screened from observation, bring forth their young, and nourish and defend them until they were strong enough to join the herd. Calves were born all the time from March to July, and sometimes even as late as August. On the summer ranges it was the habit of the cows to leave the bulls at calving time, and thus it often happened that small herds were often seen composed of bulls only. Usually the cow produced but one calf, but twins were not uncommon. Of course many calves were brought forth in the herd, but the favorite habit of the cow was as stated. As soon as the young calves were brought into the herd, which for prudential reasons occurred at the earliest possible moment, the bulls assumed the duty of protecting them from the wolves which at all times congregated in the vicinity of a herd, watching for an opportunity to seize a calf or a wounded buffalo which might be left behind. A calf always follows its mother until its successor is appointed and installed, unless separated from her by force of circumstances. They suck until they are nine months old, or even older, and Mr. McNaney once saw a lusty calf suck its mother (in January) on the Montana range several hours after she had been killed for her skin. When a buffalo is wounded it leaves the herd immediately and goes off as far from the line of pursuit as it can get, to escape the rabble of hunters, who are sure to follow the main body. If any deep ravines are at hand the wounded animal limps away to the bottom of the deepest and most secluded one, and gradually works his way up to its very head, where he finds himself in a perfect cul-de-sac, barely wide enough to admit him. Here he is so completely hidden by the high walls and numerous bends that his pursuer must needs come within a few feet of his horns before his huge bulk is visible. I have more than once been astonished at the real impregnability of the retreats selected by wounded bison. In following up wounded bulls in ravine headings it always became too dangerous to make the last stage of the pursuit on horseback, for fear of being caught in a passage so narrow as to insure a fatal accident to man or horse in case of a sudden discovery of the quarry. I have seen wounded bison shelter in situations where a single bull could easily defend himself from a whole pack of wolves, being completely walled in on both sides and the rear, and leaving his foes no point of attack save his head and horns. Bison which were nursing serious wounds most often have gone many days at a time without either food or water, and in this connection it may be mentioned that the recuperative power of a bison is really wonderful. Judging from the number of old leg wounds, fully healed, which I have found in freshly killed bisons, one may be tempted to believe that a bison never died of a broken leg. One large bull which I skeletonized had had his humerus shot squarely in two, but it had united again more firmly than ever. Another large bull had the head of his left femur and the hip socket shattered completely to pieces by a big ball, but he had entirely recovered from it, and was as lusty a runner as any bull we chased. We found that while a broken leg was a misfortune to a buffalo, it always took something more serious than that to stop him. VI. THE FOOD OF THE BISON. It is obviously impossible to enumerate all the grasses which served the bison as food on his native heath without presenting a complete list of all the plants of that order found in a given region; but it is at least desirable to know which of the grasses of the great pasture region were his favorite and most common food. It was the nutritious character and marvelous abundance of his food supply which enabled the bison to exist in such absolutely countless numbers as characterized his occupancy of the great plains. The following list comprises the grasses which were the bison\\'s principal food, named in the order of their importance: _Bouteloua oligostachya_ (buffalo, grama, or mesquite grass).--This remarkable grass formed the _pièce de résistance_ of the bison\\'s bill of fare in the days when he flourished, and it now comes to us daily in the form of beef produced of primest quality and in greatest quantity on what was until recently the great buffalo range. This grass is the most abundant and widely distributed species to be found in the great pasture region between the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains and the nineteenth degree of west longitude. It is the principal grass of the plains from Texas to the British Possessions, and even in the latter territory it is quite conspicuous. To any one but a botanist its first acquaintance means a surprise. Its name and fame lead the unacquainted to expect a grass which is tall, rank, and full of \"fodder,\" like the \"blue joint\" (_Andropogon provincialis_). The grama grass is very short, the leaves being usually not more than 2 or 3 inches in length and crowded together at the base of the stems. The flower stalk is about a foot in height, but on grazed lands are eaten off and but seldom seen. The leaves are narrow and inclined to curl, and lie close to the ground. Instead of developing a continuous growth, this grass grows in small, irregular patches, usually about the size of a man\\'s hand, with narrow strips of perfectly bare ground between them. The grass curls closely upon the ground, in a woolly carpet or cushion, greatly resembling a layer of Florida moss. Even in spring-time it never shows more color than a tint of palest green, and the landscape which is dependent upon this grass for color is never more than \"a gray and melancholy waste.\" Unlike the soft, juicy, and succulent grasses of the well-watered portions of the United States, the tiny leaves of the grama grass are hard, stiff, and dry. I have often noticed that in grazing neither cattle nor horses are able to bite off the blades, but instead each leaf is pulled out of the tuft, seemingly by its root. Notwithstanding its dry and uninviting appearance, this grass is highly nutritious, and its fat-producing qualities are unexcelled. The heat of summer dries it up effectually without destroying its nutritive elements, and it becomes for the remainder of the year excellent hay, cured on its own roots. It affords good grazing all the year round, save in winter, when it is covered with snow, and even then, if the snow is not too deep, the buffaloes, cattle, and horses paw down through it to reach the grass, or else repair to wind-swept ridges and hill-tops, where the snow has been blown off and left the grass partly exposed. Stock prefer it to all the other grasses of the plains. On bottom-lands, where moisture is abundant, this grass develops much more luxuriantly, growing in a close mass, and often to a height of a foot or more, if not grazed down, when it is cut for hay, and sometimes yields 11/2 tons to the acre. In Montana and the north it is generally known as \"buffalo-grass,\" a name to which it would seem to be fully entitled, notwithstanding the fact that this name is also applied, and quite generally, to another species, the next to be noticed. _Buchloë dactyloides_ (Southern buffalo-grass).--This species is next in value and extent of distribution to the grama grass. It also is found all over the great plains south of Nebraska and southern Wyoming, but not further north, although in many localities it occurs so sparsely as to be of little account. A single bunch of it very greatly resembles _Bouteloua oligostachya_, but its general growth is very different. It is very short, its general mass seldom rising more than 3 inches above the ground. It grows in extensive patches, and spreads by means of stolons, which sometimes are 2 feet in length, with joints every 3 or 4 inches. Owing to its southern distribution this might well be named the Southern buffalo grass, to distinguish it from the two other species of higher latitudes, to which the name \"buffalo\" has been fastened forever. _Stipa spartea_ (Northern buffalo-grass; wild oat).--This grass is found in southern Manitoba, westwardly across the plains to the Rocky Mountains, and southward as far as Montana, where it is common in many localities. On what was once the buffalo range of the British Possessions this rank grass formed the bulk of the winter pasturage, and in that region is quite as famous as our grama grass. An allied species (_Stipa viridula_, bunch-grass) is \"widely diffused over our Rocky Mountain region, extending to California and British America, and furnishing a considerable part of the wild forage of the region\" _Stipa spartea_ bears an ill name among stockmen on account of the fact that at the base of each seed is a very hard and sharp-pointed callus, which under certain circumstances (so it is said) lodges in the cheeks of domestic animals that feed upon this grass when it is dry, and which cause much trouble. But the buffalo, like the wild horse and half-wild range cattle, evidently escaped this annoyance. This grass is one of the common species over a wide area of the northern plains, and is always found on soil which is comparatively dry. In Dakota, Minnesota, and northwest Iowa it forms a considerable portion of the upland prairie hay. Of the remaining grasses it is practically impossible to single out any one as being specially entitled to fourth place in this list. There are several species which flourish in different localities, and in many respects appear to be of about equal importance as food for stock. Of these the following are the most noteworthy: _Aristida purpurea_ (Western beard-grass; purple \"bunch-grass\" of Montana).--On the high, rolling prairies of the Missouri-Yellowstone divide this grass is very abundant. It grows in little solitary bunches, about 6 inches high, scattered through the curly buffalo-grass (_Bouteloua oligostachya_). Under more favorable conditions it grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches. It is one of the prettiest grasses of that region, and in the fall and winter its purplish color makes it quite noticeable. The Montana stockmen consider it one of the most valuable grasses of that region for stock of all kinds. Mr. C. M. Jacobs assured me that the buffalo used to be very fond of this grass, and that \"wherever this grass grew in abundance there were the best hunting-grounds for the bison.\" It appears that _Aristida purpurea_ is not sufficiently abundant elsewhere in the Northwest to make it an important food for stock; but Dr. Vesey declares that it is \"abundant on the plains of Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas.\" _Koeleria cristata._--Very generally distributed from Texas and New Mexico to the British Possessions; sand hills and arid soils; mountains, up to 8,000 feet. _Poa tenuifolia_ (blue-grass of the plains and mountains).--A valuable \"bunch-grass,\" widely distributed throughout the great pasture region; grows in all sorts of soils and situations; common in the Yellowstone Park. _Festuca scabrella_ (bunch-grass).--One of the most valuable grasses of Montana and the Northwest generally; often called the \"great bunch-grass.\" It furnishes excellent food for horses and cattle, and is so tall it is cut in large quantities for hay. This is the prevailing species on the foot-hills and mountains generally, up to an altitude of 7,000 feet, where it is succeeded by _Festuca ovina_. _Andropogon provincialis_ (blue stem).--An important species, extending from eastern Kansas and Nebraska to the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains, and from Northern Texas to the Saskatchewan; common in Montana on alkali flats and bottom lands generally. This and the preceding species were of great value to the buffalo in winter, when the shorter grasses were covered with snow. _Andropogon scoparius_ (bunch grass; broom sedge; wood-grass).--Similar to the preceding in distribution and value, but not nearly so tall. None of the buffalo grasses are found in the mountains. In the mountain regions which have been visited by the buffalo and in the Yellowstone Park, where to-day the only herd remaining in a state of nature is to be found (though not by the man with a gun), the following are the grasses which form all but a small proportion of the ruminant food: _Koeleria cristata_; _Poa tenuifolia_ (Western blue-grass); _Stipa viridula_ (feather-grass); _Stipa comata_; _Agropyrum divergens_; _Agropyrum caninum_. When pressed by hunger, the buffalo used to browse on certain species of sage-brush, particularly _Atriplex canescens_ of the Southwest. But he was discriminating in the matter of diet, and as far as can be ascertained he was never known to eat the famous and much-dreaded \"loco\" weed (_Astragalus molissimus_), which to ruminant animals is a veritable drug of madness. Domestic cattle and horses often eat this plant; where it is abundant, and become demented in consequence. VII. MENTAL CAPACITY AND DISPOSITION. (1) _Reasoning from cause to effect._--The buffalo of the past was an animal of a rather low order of intelligence, and his dullness of intellect was one of the important factors in his phenomenally swift extermination. He was provokingly slow in comprehending the existence and nature of the dangers that threatened his life, and, like the stupid brute that he was, would very often stand quietly and see two or three score, or even a hundred, of his relatives and companions shot down before his eyes, with no other feeling than one of stupid wonder and curiosity. Neither the noise nor smoke of the still-hunter\\'s rifle, the falling, struggling, nor the final death of his companions conveyed to his mind the idea of a danger to be fled from, and so the herd stood still and allowed the still-hunter to slaughter its members at will. Like the Indian, and many white men also, the buffalo seemed to feel that their number was so great it could never be sensibly diminished. The presence of such a great multitude gave to each of its individuals a feeling of security and mutual support that is very generally found in animals who congregate in great herds. The time was when a band of elk would stand stupidly and wait for its members to be shot down one after another; but it is believed that this was due more to panic than to a lack of comprehension of danger. The fur seals who cover the \"hauling grounds\" of St. Paul and St. George Islands, Alaska, in countless thousands, have even less sense of danger and less comprehension of the slaughter of thousands of their kind, which takes place daily, than had the bison. They allow themselves to be herded and driven off landwards from the hauling-ground for half a mile to the killing-ground, and, finally, with most cheerful indifference, permit the Aleuts to club their brains out. It is to be added that whenever and wherever seals or sea-lions inhabit a given spot, with but few exceptions, it is an easy matter to approach individuals of the herd. The presence of an immense number of individuals plainly begets a feeling of security and mutual support. And let not the bison or the seal be blamed for this, for man himself exhibits the same foolish instinct. Who has not met the woman of mature years and full intellectual vigor who is mortally afraid to spend a night entirely alone in her own house, but is perfectly willing to do so, and often does do so without fear, when she can have the company of one small and helpless child, or, what is still worse, three or four of them! But with the approach of extermination, and the utter breaking up of all the herds, a complete change has been wrought in the character of the bison. At last, but alas! entirely too late, the crack of the rifle and its accompanying puff of smoke conveyed to the slow mind of the bison a sense of deadly danger to himself. At last he recognized man, whether on foot or horseback, or peering at him from a coulée, as his mortal enemy. At last he learned to run. In 1886 we found the scattered remnant of the great northern herd the wildest and most difficult animals to kill that we had ever hunted in any country. It had been only through the keenest exercise of all their powers of self-preservation that those buffaloes had survived until that late day, and we found them almost as swift as antelopes and far more wary. The instant a buffalo caught sight of a man, even though a mile distant, he was off at the top of his speed, and generally ran for some wild region several miles away. In our party was an experienced buffalo-hunter, who in three years had slaughtered over three thousand head for their hides. He declared that if he could ever catch a \"bunch\" at rest he could \"get a stand\" the same as he used to do, and kill several head before the rest would run. It so happened that the first time we found buffaloes we discovered a bunch of fourteen head, lying in the sun at noon, on the level top of a low butte, all noses pointing up the wind. We stole up within range and fired. At the instant the first shot rang out up sprang every buffalo as if he had been thrown upon his feet by steel springs, and in a second\\'s time the whole bunch was dashing away from us with the speed of race-horses. Our buffalo-hunter declared that in chasing buffaloes we could count with certainty upon their always running against the wind, for this had always been their habit. Although this was once their habit, we soon found that those who now represent the survival of the fittest have learned better wisdom, and now run (1) away from their pursuer and (2) toward the best hiding place. Now they pay no attention whatever to the direction of the wind, and if a pursuer follows straight behind, a buffalo may change his course three or four times in a 10-mile chase. An old bull once led one of our hunters around three-quarters of a circle which had a diameter of 5 or 6 miles. The last buffaloes were mentally as capable of taking care of themselves as any animals I ever hunted. The power of original reasoning which they manifested in scattering all over a given tract of rough country, like hostile Indians when hotly pressed by soldiers, in the Indian-like manner in which they hid from sight in deep hollows, and, as we finally proved, in _grazing only in ravines and hollows_, proved conclusively that _but for the use of fire-arms_ those very buffaloes would have been actually safe from harm by man, and that they would have increased indefinitely. As they were then, the Indians\\' arrows and spears could never have been brought to bear upon them, save in rare instances, for they had thoroughly learned to dread man and fly from him for their lives. Could those buffaloes have been protected from rifles and revolvers the resultant race would have displayed far more active mental powers, keener vision, and finer physique than the extinguished race possessed. In fleeing from an enemy the buffalo ran against the wind, in order that his keen scent might save him from the disaster of running upon new enemies; which was an idea wholly his own, and not copied by any other animal so far as known. But it must be admitted that the buffalo of the past was very often a most stupid reasoner. He would deliberately walk into a quicksand, where hundreds of his companions were already ingulfed and in their death-struggle. He would quit feeding, run half a mile, and rush headlong into a moving train of cars that happened to come between him and the main herd on the other side of the track. He allowed himself to be impounded and slaughtered by a howling mob in a rudely constructed pen, which a combined effort on the part of three or four old bulls would have utterly demolished at any point. A herd of a thousand buffaloes would allow an armed hunter to gallop into their midst, very often within arm\\'s-length, when any of the bulls nearest him might easily have bowled him over and had him trampled to death in a moment. The hunter who would ride in that manner into a herd of the Cape buffaloes of Africa (_Bubalus caffer_) would be unhorsed and killed before he had gone half a furlong. (2) _Curiosity._--The buffalo of the past possessed but little curiosity; he was too dull to entertain many unnecessary thoughts. Had he possessed more of this peculiar trait, which is the mark of an inquiring mind, he would much sooner have accomplished a comprehension of the dangers that proved his destruction. His stolid indifference to everything he did not understand cost him his existence, although in later years he displayed more interest in his environment. On one occasion in hunting I staked my success with an old bull I was pursuing on the chance that when he reached the crest of a ridge his curiosity would prompt him to pause an instant to look at me. Up to that moment he had had only one quick glance at me before he started to run. As he climbed the slope ahead of me, in full view, I dismounted and made ready to fire the instant he should pause to look at me. As I expected, he did come to a fall stop on the crest of the ridge, and turned half around to look at me. But for his curiosity I should have been obliged to fire at him under very serious disadvantages. (3) _Fear._--With the buffalo, fear of man is now the ruling passion. Says Colonel Dodge: \"He is as timid about his flank and rear as a raw recruit. When traveling nothing in front stops him, but an unusual object in the rear will send him to the right-about [toward the main body of the herd] at the top of his speed.\" (4) _Courage._--It was very seldom that the buffalo evinced any courage save that of despair, which even cowards possess. Unconscious of his strength, his only thought was flight, and it was only when brought to bay that he was ready to fight. Now and then, however, in the chase, the buffalo turned upon his pursuer and overthrew horse and rider. Sometimes the tables were completely turned, and the hunter found his only safety in flight. During the buffalo slaughter the butchers sometimes had narrow escapes from buffaloes supposed to be dead or mortally wounded, and a story comes from the great northern range south of Glendive of a hunter who was killed by an old bull whose tongue he had actually cut out in the belief that he was dead. Sometimes buffalo cows display genuine courage in remaining with their calves in the presence of danger, although in most cases they left their offspring to their fate. During a hunt for live buffalo calves, undertaken by Mr. C. J. Jones of Garden City, Kans., in 1886, and very graphically described by a staff correspondent of the American Field in a series of articles in that journal under the title of \"The Last of the Buffalo,\" the following remarkable incident occurred:[41] [Note 41: American Field, July 24, 1886, p. 78.] \"The last calf was caught by Carter, who roped it neatly as Mr. Jones cut it out of the herd and turned it toward him. This was a fine heifer calf, and was apparently the idol of her mother\\'s heart, for the latter came very near making a casualty the price of the capture. As soon as the calf was roped, the old cow left the herd and charged on Carter viciously, as he bent over his victim. Seeing the danger, Mr. Jones rode in at just the nick of time, and drove the cow off for a moment; but she returned again and again, and finally began charging him whenever he came near; so that, much as he regretted it, he had to shoot her with his revolver, which he did, killing her almost immediately.\" The mothers of the thirteen other calves that were caught by Mr. Jones\\'s party allowed their offspring to be \"cut out,\" lassoed, and tied, while they themselves devoted all their energies to leaving them as far behind as possible. (5) _Affection._--While the buffalo cows manifested a fair degree of affection for their young, the adult bulls of the herd often displayed a sense of responsibility for the safety of the calves that was admirable, to say the least. Those who have had opportunities for watching large herds tell us that whenever wolves approached and endeavored to reach a calf the old bulls would immediately interpose and drive the enemy away. It was a well-defined habit for the bulls to form the outer circle of every small group or section of a great herd, with the calves in the center, well guarded from the wolves, which regarded them as their most choice prey. Colonel Dodge records a remarkable incident in illustration of the manner in which the bull buffaloes protected the calves of the herd.[42] [Note 42: Plains of the Great West, p. 125.] \"The duty of protecting the calves devolved almost entirely on the bulls. I have seen evidences of this many times, but the most remarkable instance I have ever heard of was related to me by an army surgeon, who was an eye-witness. \"He was one evening returning to camp after a day\\'s hunt, when his attention was attracted by the curious action of a little knot of six or eight buffalo. Approaching sufficiently near to see clearly, he discovered that this little knot were all bulls, standing in a close circle, with their heads outwards, while in a concentric circle at some 12 or 15 paces distant sat, licking their chaps in impatient expectancy, at least a dozen large gray wolves (excepting man, the most dangerous enemy of the buffalo). \"The doctor determined to watch the performance. After a few moments the knot broke up, and, still keeping in a compact mass, started on a trot for the main herd, some half a mile oft\". To his very great astonishment, the doctor now saw that the central and controlling figure of this mass was a poor little calf so newly born as scarcely to be able to walk. After going 50 or 100 paces the calf laid down, the bulls disposed themselves in a circle as before, and the wolves, who had trotted along on each side of their retreating supper, sat down and licked their chaps again; and though the doctor did not see the finale, it being late and the camp distant, he had no doubt that the noble fathers did their whole duty by their offspring, and carried it safely to the herd.\" (6) _Temper._--I have asked many old buffalo hunters for facts in regard to the temper and disposition of herd buffaloes, and all agree that they are exceedingly quiet, peace loving, and even indolent animals at all times save during the rutting season. Says Colonel Dodge: \"The habits of the buffalo are almost identical with those of the domestic cattle. Owing either to a more pacific disposition, or to the greater number of bulls, there, is very little fighting, even at the season when it might be expected. I have been among them for days, have watched their conduct for hours at a time, and with the very best opportunities for observation, but have never seen a regular combat between bulls. They frequently strike each other with their horns, but this seems to be a mere expression of impatience at being crowded.\" In referring to the \"running season\" of the buffalo, Mr. Catlin says: \"It is no uncommon thing at this season, at these gatherings, to see several thousands in a mass eddying and wheeling about under a cloud of dust, which is raised by the bulls as they are pawing in the dirt, or engaged in desperate combats, as they constantly are, plunging and butting at each other in a most furious manner.\" On the whole, the disposition of the buffalo is anything but vicious. Both sexes yield with surprising readiness to the restraints of captivity, and in a remarkably short time become, if taken young, as fully domesticated as ordinary cattle. Buffalo calves are as easily tamed as domestic ones, and make very interesting pets. A prominent trait of character in the captive buffalo is a mulish obstinacy or headstrong perseverance under certain circumstances that is often very annoying. When a buffalo makes up his mind to go through a fence, he is very apt to go through, either peaceably or by force, as occasion requires. Fortunately, however, the captive animals usually accept a fence in the proper spirit, and treat it with a fair degree of respect. VIII. VALUE OF THE BUFFALO TO MAN. It may fairly be supposed that if the people of this country could have been made to realize the immense money value of the great buffalo herds as they existed in 1870, a vigorous and successful effort would have been made to regulate and restrict the slaughter. The fur seal of Alaska, of which about 100,000 are killed annually for their skins, yield an annual revenue to the Government of $100,000 and add $900,000 more to the actual wealth of the United States. It pays to protect those seals, and we mean to protect them against all comers who seek their unrestricted slaughter, no matter whether the poachers be American, English, Russian, or Canadian. It would be folly to do otherwise, and if those who would exterminate the fur seal by shooting them in the water will not desist for the telling, then they must by the compelling. The fur seal is a good investment for the United States, and their number is not diminishing. As the buffalo herds existed in 1870, 500,000 head of bulls, young and old, could have been killed every year for a score of years without sensibly diminishing the size of the herds. At a low estimate these could easily have been made to yield various products worth $5 each, as follows: Kobe, $2.50; tongue, 20 cents; meat of hindquarters, $2; bones, horns, and hoofs, 25 cents; total, $5. And the amount annually added to the wealth of the United States would have been $2,500,000. On all the robes taken for the market, say, 200,000, the Government could have collected a tax of 50 cents each, which would have yielded a sum doubly sufficient to have maintained a force of mounted police fully competent to enforce the laws regulating the slaughter. Had a contract for the protection of the buffalo been offered at $50,000 per annum, ay, or even half that sum, an army of competent men would have competed for it every year, and it could have been carried out to the letter. But, as yet, the American people have not learned to spend money for the protection of valuable game; and by the time they do learn it, there will be no game to protect. Even despite the enormous waste of raw material that ensued in the utilization of the buffalo product, the total cash value of all the material derived from this source, if it could only be reckoned up, would certainly amount to many millions of dollars--perhaps twenty millions, all told. This estimate may, to some, seem high, but when we stop to consider that in eight years, from 1876 to 1884, a single firm, that of Messrs. J. & A. Boskowitz, 105 Greene street, New York, paid out the enormous sum of $923,070 (nearly one million) for robes and hides, and that in a single year (1882) another firm, that of Joseph Ullman, 165 Mercer street, New York, paid out $216,250 for robes and hides, it may not seem so incredible. Had there been a deliberate plan for the suppression of all statistics relating to the slaughter of buffalo in the United States, and what it yielded, the result could not have been more complete barrenness than exists to-day in regard to this subject. There is only one railway company which kept its books in such a manner as to show the kind and quantity of its business at that time. Excepting this, nothing is known definitely. Fortunately, enough facts and figures were recorded during the hunting operations of the Red River half-breeds to enable us, by bringing them all together, to calculate with sufficient exactitude the value of the buffalo to them from 1820 to 1840. The result ought to be of interest to all who think it is not worth while to spend money in preserving our characteristic game animals. In Ross\\'s \"Red River Settlement,\" pp. 242-273, and Schoolcraft\\'s \"North American Indians,\" Part iv, pp. 101-110, are given detailed accounts of the conduct and results of two hunting expeditions by the half-breeds, with many valuable statistics. On this data we base our calculation. Taking the result of one particular day\\'s slaughter as an index to the methods of the hunters in utilizing the products of the chase, we find that while \"not less than 2,500 animals were killed,\" out of that number only 375 bags of pemmican and 240 bales of dried meat were made. \"Now,\" says Mr. Ross,\" making all due allowance for waste, 750 animals would have been ample for such a result. What, then, we might ask, became of the remaining 1,750! * * * Scarcely one-third in number of the animals killed is turned to account.\" A bundle of dried meat weighs 60 to 70 pounds, and a bag of pemmican 100 to 110 pounds. If economically worked up, a whole buffalo cow yields half a bag of pemmican (about 55 pounds) and three-fourths of a bundle of dried meat (say 45 pounds). The most economical calculate that from eight to ten cows are required to load a single Red River cart. The proceeds of 1,776 cows once formed 228 bags of pemmican, 1,213 bales of dried meat, 166 sacks of tallow, each weighing 200 pounds, 556 bladders of marrow weighing 12 pounds each, and the value of the whole was $8,160. The total of the above statement is 132,057 pounds of buffalo product for 1,776 cows, or within a fraction of 75 pounds to each cow. The bulls and young animals killed were not accounted for. The expedition described by Mr. Ross contained 1,210 carts and 620 hunters, and returned with 1,089,000 pounds of meat, making 900 pounds for each cart, and 200 pounds for each individual in the expedition, of all ages and both sexes. Allowing, as already ascertained, that of the above quantity of product every 75 pounds represents one cow saved and two and one third buffaloes wasted, it means that 14,520 buffaloes were killed and utilized and 33,250 buffaloes were killed and eaten fresh or wasted, and 47,770 buffaloes were killed by 620 hunters, or an average of 77 buffaloes to each hunter. The total number of buffaloes killed for each cart was 39. Allowing, what was actually the case, that every buffalo killed would, if properly cared for, have yielded meat, fat, and robe worth at least $5, the total value of the buffaloes slaughtered by that expedition amounted to $258,850, and of which the various products actually utilized represented a cash value of $72,001 added to the wealth of the Red River half-breeds. In 1820 there went 540 carts to the buffalo plains; in 1825, 680; in 1830, 820; in 1835, 970; in 1840, 1,210. From 1820 to 1825 the average for each year was 610; from 1825 to 1830, 750; from 1830 to 1835, 895; from 1835 to 1840, 1,000. Accepting the statements of eye-witnesses that for every buffalo killed two and one-third buffaloes are wasted or eaten on the spot, and that every loaded cart represented thirty-nine dead buffaloes which were worth when utilized $5 each, we have the following series of totals: From 1820 to 1825 five expeditions, of 610 carts each, killed 118,950 buffaloes, worth $594,750. From 1825 to 1830 five expeditions, of 750 carts each, killed 146,250 buffaloes, worth $731,250. From 1830 to 1835 five expeditions, of 895 carts each, killed 174,525 buffaloes, worth $872,625. From 1835 to 1840 five expeditions, of 1,090 carts each, killed 212,550 buffaloes, worth $1,062,750. Total number of buffaloes killed in twenty years,[43] $652,275; total value of buffaloes killed in twenty years,[43] $3,261,375; total value of the product utilized[43] and added to the wealth of the settlements, $978,412. [Note 43: By the Red River half-breeds only.] The Eskimo has his seal, which yields nearly everything that he requires; the Korak of Siberia depends for his very existence upon his reindeer; the Ceylon native has the cocoa-nut palm, which leaves him little else to desire, and the North American Indian had the American, bison. If any animal was ever designed by the hand of nature for the express purpose of supplying, at one stroke, nearly all the wants of an entire race, surely the buffalo was intended for the Indian. And right well was this gift of the gods utilized by the children of nature to whom it came. Up to the time when the United States Government began to support our Western Indians by the payment of annuities and furnishing quarterly supplies of food, clothing, blankets, cloth, tents, etc., the buffalo had been the main dependence of more than 50,000 Indians who inhabited the buffalo range and its environs. Of the many different uses to which the buffalo and his various parts were, put by the red man, the following were the principal ones: The body of the buffalo yielded fresh meat, of which thousands of tons were consumed; dried meat, prepared in summer for winter use; pemmican (also prepared in summer), of meat, fat, and berries; tallow, made up into large balls or sacks, and kept in store; marrow, preserved in bladders; and tongues, dried and smoked, and eaten as a delicacy. The skin of the buffalo yielded a robe, dressed with the hair on, for clothing and bedding; a hide, dressed without the hair, which made a teepee cover, when a number were sewn together; boats, when sewn together in a green state, over a wooden framework. Shields, made from the thickest portions, as rawhide; ropes, made up as rawhide; clothing of many kinds; bags for use in traveling; coffins, or winding sheets for the dead, etc. Other portions utilized were sinews, which furnished fiber for ropes, thread, bow-strings, snow-shoe webs, etc.; hair, which was sometimes made into belts and ornaments; \"buffalo chips,\" which formed a valuable and highly-prized fuel; bones, from which many articles of use and ornament were made; horns, which were made into spoons, drinking vessels, etc. After the United States Government began to support the buffalo-hunting Indians with annuities and supplies, the woolen blanket and canvas tent took the place of the buffalo robe and the skin-covered teepee, and \"Government beef\" took the place of buffalo meat. But the slaughter of buffaloes went on just the same, and the robes and hides taken were traded for useless and often harmful luxuries, such as canned provisions, fancy knickknacks, whisky, fire-arms of the most approved pattern, and quantities of fixed ammunition. During the last ten years of the existence of the herds it is an open question whether the buffalo did not do our Indians more harm than good. Amongst the Crows, who were liberally provided for by the Government, horse racing was a common pastime, and the stakes were usually dressed buffalo robes.[44] [Note 44: On one occasion, which is doubtless still remembered with bitterness by many a Crow of the Custer Agency, my old friend Jim McNaney backed his horse Ogalalla against the horses of the whole Crow tribe. The Crows forthwith formed a pool, which consisted of a huge pile of buffalo robes, worth about $1,200, and with it backed their best race-horse. He was forthwith \"beaten out of sight\" by Ogalalla, and another grievance was registered against the whites.] The total disappearance of the buffalo has made no perceptible difference in the annual cost of the Indians to the Government. During the years when buffaloes were numerous and robes for the purchase of fire-arms and cartridges were plentiful, Indian wars were frequent, and always costly to the Government. The Indians were then quite independent, because they could take the war path at any time and live on buffalo indefinitely. Now, the case is very different. The last time Sitting Bull went on the war-path and was driven up into Manitoba, he had the doubtful pleasure of living on his ponies and dogs until he became utterly starved out. Since his last escapade, the Sioux have been compelled to admit that the game is up and the war-path is open to them no longer. Should they wish to do otherwise they know that they could survive only by killing cattle, and cattle that are guarded by cowboys and ranchmen are no man\\'s game. Therefore, while we no longer have to pay for an annual campaign in force against hostile Indians, the total absence of the buffalo brings upon the nation the entire support of the Indian, and the cash outlay each year is as great as ever. The value of the American bison to civilized man can never be calculated, nor even fairly estimated. It may with safety be said, however, that it has been probably tenfold greater than most persons have ever supposed. It would be a work of years to gather statistics of the immense bulk of robes and hides, undoubtedly amounting to millions in the aggregate; the thousands of tons of meat, and the train-loads of bones which have been actually utilized by man. Nor can the effect of the bison\\'s presence upon the general development of the great West ever be calculated. It has sunk into the great sum total of our progress, and well nigh lost to sight forever. As a mere suggestion of the immense value of \"the buffalo product\" at the time when it had an existence, I have obtained from two of our leading fur houses in New York City, with branches elsewhere, a detailed statement of their business in buffalo robes and hides during the last few years of the trade. They not only serve to show the great value of the share of the annual crop that passed through their hands, but that of Messrs. J. & A. Boskowitz is of especial value, because, being carefully itemized throughout, it shows the decline and final failure of the trade in exact figures. I am under many obligations to both these firms for their kindness in furnishing the facts I desired, and especially to the Messrs. Boskowitz, who devoted considerable time and labor to the careful compilation of the annexed statement of their business in buffalo skins. _Memorandum of buffalo robes and hides bought by Messrs J. & A. Boskowitz, 101-105 Greene Street, New York, and 202 Lake street, Chicago, from 1876 to 1884._ +----------------------------------------+ |Year | Buffalo robes. | Buffalo hides. | | |Number.| Cost. | Number.|Cost. | +-----+-------+---------+--------+-------+ |1876 | 31,838| $39,620| None.| ... | |1877 | 9,353| 35,560| None.| ... | |1878 | 41,268| 150,600| None.| ... | |1879 | 28,613| 110,420| None.| ... | |1880 | 34,901| 176,200| 4,570|$13,140| |1881 | 23,355| 151,800| 26,601| 89,030| |1882 | 2,124| 15,600| 15,464| 44,140| |1883 | 6,690| 29,770| 21,869| 67,190| |1884 | None.| ...| 529| 1,720| +-----+-------+---------+--------+-------+ |Total|177,142|$709,570 | 69,033|215,220| +----------------------------------------+ Total number of buffalo skins handled in nine years, 246,175; total cost, $924,790. I have also been favored with some very interesting facts and figures regarding the business done in buffalo skins by the firm of Mr. Joseph Ullman, exporter and importer of furs and robes, of 165-107 Mercer street, New York, and also 353 Jackson street, St. Paul, Minnesota. The following letter was written me by Mr. Joseph Ullman on November 12, 1887, for which I am greatly indebted: \"Inasmuch as you particularly desire the figures for the years 1880-\\'86, I have gone through my buffalo robe and hide accounts of those years, and herewith give you approximate figures, as there are a good many things to be considered which make it difficult to give exact figures. \"In 1881 we handled about 14,000 hides, average cost about $3.50, and 12,000 robes, average cost about $7.50. \"In 1882 we purchased between 35,000 and 40,000 hides, at an average cost of about $3.50, and about 10,000 robes, at an average cost of about $8.50. \"In 1883 we purchased from 6,000 to 7,000 hides and about 1,500 to 2,000 robes at a slight advance in price against the year previous. \"In 1884 we purchased less than 2,500 hides, and in my opinion these were such as were carried over from the previous season in the Northwest, and were not fresh-slaughtered skins. The collection of robes this season was also comparatively small, and nominally robes carried over from 1883. \"In 1885 the collection of hides amounted to little or nothing. \"The aforesaid goods were all purchased direct in the Northwest, that is to say, principally in Montana, and shipped in care of our branch house at St. Paul, Minnesota, to Joseph Ullman, Chicago. The robes mentioned above were Indian-tanned robes and were mainly disposed of to the jobbing trade both East and West. \"In 1881 and the years prior, the hides were divided into two kinds, viz, robe hides, which were such as had a good crop of fur and were serviceable for robe purposes, and the heavy and short-furred bull hides. The former were principally sold to the John S. Way Manufacturing Company, Bridgeport, Connecticut, and to numerous small robe tanners, while the latter were sold for leather purposes to various hide-tanners throughout the United States and Canada, and brought 51/2 to 81/2 cents per pound. A very large proportion of these latter were tanned by the Wilcox Tanning Company, Wilcox, Pennsylvania. \"About the fall of 1882 we established a tannery for buffalo robes in Chicago, and from that time forth we tanned all the good hides which we received into robes and disposed of them in the same manner as the Indian-tanned robes. \"I don\\'t know that I am called upon to express an opinion as to the benefit or disadvantage of the extermination of the buffalo, but nevertheless take the liberty to say that I think that some proper law restricting the unpardonable slaughter of the buffalo should have been enacted at the time. It is a well-known fact that soon after the Northern Pacific Railroad opened up that portion of the country, thereby making the transportation of the buffalo hides feasible, that is to say, reducing the cost of freight, thousands upon thousands of buffaloes were killed for the sake of the hide alone, while the carcasses were left to rot on the open plains. \"The average prices paid the buffalo hunters [from 1880 to 1884] was about as follows: For cow hides [robes!], $3; bull hides, $2.50; yearlings, $1.50; calves, 75 cents; and the cost of getting the hides to market brought the cost up to about $3.50 per hide.\" The amount actually paid out by Joseph Ullman, in four years, for buffalo robes and hides was about $310,000, and this, too, long after the great southern herd had ceased to exist, and when the northern herd furnished the sole supply. It thus appears that during the course of eight years business (leaving out the small sum paid out in 1884), on the part of the Messrs. Boskowitz, and four years on that of Mr. Joseph Ullman, these two firms alone paid out the enormous sum of $1,233,070 for buffalo robes and hides which they purchased to sell again at a good profit. By the time their share of the buffalo product reached the consumers it must have represented an actual money value of about $2,000,000. Besides these two firms there were at that time many others who also handled great quantities of buffalo skins and hides for which they paid out immense sums of money. In this country the other leading firms engaged in this business were I. G. Baker & Co., of Fort Benton; P. B. Weare & Co., Chicago; Obern, Hoosick & Co., Chicago and Saint Paul; Martin Bates & Co., and Messrs. Shearer, Nichols & Co. (now Hurlburt, Shearer & Sanford), of New York. There were also many others whose names I am now unable to recall. In the British Possessions and Canada the frontier business was largely monopolized by the Hudson\\'s Bay Fur Company, although the annual \"output\" of robes and hides was but small in comparison with that gathered in the United States, where the herds were far more numerous. Even in their most fruitful locality for robes--the country south of the Saskatchewan--this company had a very powerful competitor in the firm of I. G. Baker & Co., of Fort Benton, which secured the lion\\'s share of the spoil and sent it down the Missouri River. It is quite certain that the utilization of the buffalo product, even so far as it was accomplished, resulted in the addition of several millions of dollars to the wealth of the people of the United States. That the total sum, could it be reckoned up, would amount to at least fifteen millions, seems reasonably certain; and my own impression is that twenty millions would be nearer the mark. It is much to be regretted that the exact truth can never be known, for in this age of universal slaughter a knowledge of the cash value of the wild game of the United States that has been killed up to date might go far toward bringing about the actual as well as the theoretical protection of what remains. * * * * * UTILIZATION OF THE BUFFALO BY WHITE MEN. _Robes._--Ordinarily the skin of a large ruminant is of little value in comparison with the bulk of toothsome flesh it covers. In fattening domestic cattle for the market, the value of the hide is so insignificant that it amounts to no more than a butcher\\'s perquisite in reckoning up the value of the animal. With the buffalo, however, so enormous was the waste of the really available product that probably nine-tenths of the total value derived from the slaughter of the animal came from his skin alone. Of this, about four-fifths came from the utilization of the furry robe and one-fifth from skins classed as \"hides,\" which were either taken in the summer season, when the hair was very short or almost absent, and used for the manufacture of leather and leather goods, or else were the poorly-furred skins of old bulls. The season for robe-taking was from October 15 to February 15, and a little later in the more northern latitudes. In the United States the hair of the buffalo was still rather short up to the first of November; but by the middle of November it was about at its finest as to length, density, color, and freshness. The Montana hunters considered that the finest robes were those taken from November 15 to December 15. Before the former date the hair had not quite attained perfection in length, and after the latter it began to show wear and lose color. The winter storms of December and January began to leave their mark upon the robes by the 1st of February, chiefly by giving the hair a bleached and weathered appearance. By the middle of February the pelage was decidedly on the wane, and the robe-hunter was also losing his energy. Often, however, the hunt was kept up until the middle of March, until either the deterioration of the quality of the robe, the migration of the herds northward, or the hunter\\'s longing to return \"to town\" and \"clean up,\" brought the hunt to an end. On the northern buffalo range, the hunter, or \"buffalo skinner,\" removed the robe in the following manner: When the operator had to do his work alone, which was almost always the case, he made haste to skin his victims while they were yet warm, if possible, and before _rigor mortis_ had set in; but, at all hazards, before they should become hard frozen. With a warm buffalo he could easily do his work single-handed, but with one rigid or frozen stiff it was a very different matter. His first act was to heave the carcass over until it lay fairly upon its back, with its feet up in the air. To keep it in that position he wrenched the head violently around to one side, close against the shoulder, at the point where the hump was highest and the tendency to roll the greatest, and used it very effectually as a chock to keep the body from rolling back upon its side. Having fixed the carcass in position he drew forth his steel, sharpened his sharp-pointed \"ripping-knife,\" and at once proceeded to make all the opening cuts in the skin. Each leg was girdled to the bone, about 8 inches above the hoof, and the skin of the leg ripped open from that point along the inside to the median line of the body. A long, straight cut was then made along the middle of the breast and abdomen, from the root of the tail to the chin. In skinning cows and young animals, nothing but the skin of the forehead and nose was left on the skull, the skin of the throat and cheeks being left on the hide; but in skinning old bulls, on whose heads the skin was very thick and tough, the whole head was left unskinned, to save labor and time. The skin of the neck was severed in a circle around the neck, just behind the ears. It is these huge heads of bushy brown hair, looking, at a little distance, quite black, in sharp contrast with the ghastly whiteness of the perfect skeletons behind them, which gives such a weird and ghostly appearance to the lifeless prairies of Montana where the bone-gatherer has not yet done his perfect work. The skulls of the cows and young buffaloes are as clean and bare as if they had been carefully macerated, and bleached by a skilled osteologist. [Illustration: FIG. 1. A DEAD BULL. From a photograph by L. A. Huffman.] [Illustration: FIG. 2. BUFFALO SKINNERS AT WORK. From a photograph by L. A. Huffman.] The opening cuts having been made, the broad-pointed \"skinning-knife\" was duly sharpened, and with it the operator fell to work to detach the skin from the body in the shortest possible time. The tail was always skinned and left on the hide. As soon as the skin was taken off it was spread out on a clean, smooth, and level spot of ground, and stretched to its fullest extent, inside uppermost. On the northern range, very few skins were \"pegged out,\" _i. e._, stretched thoroughly and held by means of wooden pegs driven through the edges of the skin into the earth. It was practiced to a limited extent on the southern range during the latter part of the great slaughter, when buffaloes were scarce and time abundant. Ordinarily, however, there was no time for pegging, nor were pegs available on the range to do the work with. A warm skin stretched on the curly buffalo-grass, hair side down, sticks to the ground of itself until it has ample time to harden. On the northern range the skinner always cut the initials of his outfit in the thin subcutaneous muscle which was always found adhering to the skin on each side, and which made a permanent and very plain mark of ownership. In the south, the traders who bought buffalo robes on the range sometimes rigged up a rude press, with four upright posts and a huge lever, in which robes that had been folded into a convenient size were pressed into bales, like bales of cotton. These could be transported by wagon much more economically than could loose robes. An illustration of this process is given in an article by Theodore R. Davis, entitled \"The Buffalo Range,\" in _Harper\\'s Magazine_ for January, 1869, Vol. xxxviii, p. 163. The author describes the process as follows: \"As the robes are secured, the trader has them arranged in lots of ten each, with but little regard for quality other than some care that particularly fine robes do not go too many in one lot. These piles are then pressed into a compact bale by means of a rudely constructed affair composed of saplings and a chain.\" On the northern range, skins were not folded until the time came to haul them in. Then the hunter repaired to the scene of his winter\\'s work, with a wagon surmounted by a hay-rack (or something like it), usually drawn by four horses. As the skins were gathered up they were folded once, lengthwise down the middle, with the hair inside. Sometimes as many as 100 skins were hauled at one load by four horses. On one portion of the northern range the classification of buffalo peltries was substantially as follows: Under the head _of robes_ was included all cow skins taken during the proper season, from one year old upward, and all bull skins from one to three years old. Bull skins over three years of age were classed as _hides_, and while the best of them were finally tanned and used as robes, the really poor ones were converted into leather. The large robes, when tanned, were used very generally throughout the colder portions of North America as sleigh robes and wraps, and for bedding in the regions of extreme cold. The small robes, from the young animals, and likewise many large robes, were made into overcoats, at once the warmest and the most cumbersome that ever enveloped a human being. Thousands of old bull robes were tanned with the hair on, and the body portions were made into overshoes, with the woolly hair inside--absurdly large and uncouth, but very warm. I never wore a pair of buffalo overshoes without being torn by conflicting emotions--mortification at the ridiculous size of my combined foot-gear, big boots inside of huge overshoes, and supreme comfort derived from feet that were always warm. Besides the ordinary robe, the hunters and fur buyers of Montana recognized four special qualities, as follows: The \"beaver robe,\" with exceedingly fine, wavy fur, the color of a beaver, and having long, coarse, straight hairs coming through it. The latter were of course plucked out in the process of manufacture. These were very rare. In 1882 Mr. James McNaney took one, a cow robe, the only one out of 1,200 robes taken that season, and sold it for $75, when ordinary robes fetched only $3.50. The \"black-and-tan robe\" is described as having the nose, flanks, and inside of fore legs black-and-tan (whatever that may mean), while the remainder of the robe is jet black. A \"buckskin robe\" is from what is always called a \"white buffalo,\" and is in reality a dirty cream color instead of white. A robe of this character sold in Miles City in 1882 for $200, and was the only one of that character taken on the northern range during that entire winter. A very few pure white robes have been taken, so I have been told, chiefly by Indians, but I have never seen one. A \"blue robe\" or \"mouse-colored (?) robe\" is one on which the body color shows a decidedly bluish cast, and at the same time has long, fine fur. Out of his 1,200 robes taken in 1882, Mr. McNaney picked out 12 which passed muster as the much sought for blue robes, and they sold at $16 each. As already intimated, the price paid on the range for ordinary buffalo skins varied according to circumstances, and at different periods, and in different localities, ranged all the way from 65 cents to $10. The latter figure was paid in Texas in 1887 for the last lot of \"robes\" ever taken. The lowest prices ever paid were during the tremendous slaughter which annihilated the southern herd. Even as late as 1876, in the southern country, cow robes brought on the range only from 65 to 90 cents, and bull robes $1.15. On the northern range, from 1881 to 1883, the prices paid were much higher, ranging from $2.50 to $4. [Illustration: FIG. 1. FIVE MINUTES\\' WORK. Photographed by L. A. Huffman.] [Illustration: FIG. 2. SCENE ON THE NORTHERN BUFFALO RANGE. Photographed by L. A. Huffman.] A few hundred dressed robes still remain in the hands of some of the largest fur dealers in New York, Chicago, and Montreal, which can be purchased at prices much lower than one would expect, considering the circumstances. In 1888, good robes, Indian tanned, were offered in New York at prices ranging from $15 to $30, according to size and quality, but in Montreal no first-class robes were obtainable at less than $40. _Hides._--Next in importance to robes was the class of skins known commercially as hides. Under this head were classed all skins which for any reason did not possess the pelage necessary to a robe, and were therefore fit only for conversion into leather. Of these, the greater portion consisted of the skins of old bulls on which the hair was of poor quality and the skin itself too thick and heavy to ever allow of its being made into a soft, pliable, and light-weight robe. The remaining portion of the hides marketed were from buffaloes killed in spring and summer, when the body and hindquarters ware almost naked. Apparently the quantity of summer-killed hides marketed was not very great, for it was only the meanest and most unprincipled ones of the grand army of buffalo-killers who were mean enough to kill buffaloes in summer simply for their hides. It is said that at one time summer-killing was practiced on the southern range to an extent that became a cause for alarm to the great body of more respectable hunters, and the practice was frowned upon so severely that the wretches who engaged in it found it wise to abandon it. _Bones._--Next in importance to robes and hides was the bone product, the utilization of which was rendered possible by the rigorous climate of the buffalo plains. Under the influence of the wind and sun and the extremes of heat and cold, the flesh remaining upon a carcass dried up, disintegrated, and fell to dust, leaving the bones of almost the entire skeleton as clean and bare as if they had been stripped of flesh by some powerful chemical process. Very naturally, no sooner did the live buffaloes begin to grow scarce than the miles of bleaching\\' bones suggested the idea of finding a use for them. A market was readily found for them in the East, and the prices paid per ton were sufficient to make the business of bone-gathering quite remunerative. The bulk of the bone product was converted into phosphate for fertilizing purposes, but much of it was turned into carbon for use in the refining of sugar. The gathering of bones became a common industry as early as 1872, during which year 1,135,300 pounds were shipped over the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad. In the year following the same road shipped 2,743,100 pounds, and in 1874 it handled 6,914,950 pounds more. This trade continued from that time on until the plains have been gleaned so far back from the railway lines that it is no longer profitable to seek them. For that matter, however, it is said that south of the Union Pacific nothing worth the seeking now remains. The building of the Northern Pacific Railway made possible the shipment of immense quantities of dry bones. Even as late as 1886 overland travelers saw at many of the stations between Jamestown, Dakota, and Billings, Montana, immense heaps of bones lying alongside the track awaiting shipment. In 1885 a single firm shipped over 200 tons of bones from Miles City. The valley of the Missouri River was gleaned by teamsters who gathered bones from as far back as 100 miles and hauled them to the river for shipment on the steamers. An operator who had eight wagons in the business informed me that in order to ship bones on the river steamers it was necessary to crush them, and that for crushed bones, shipped in bags, a Michigan fertilizer company paid $18 per ton. Uncrushed bones, shipped by the railway, sold for $12 per ton. It is impossible to ascertain the total amount or value of the bone product, but it is certain that it amounted to many thousand tons, and in value must have amounted to some hundreds of thousands of dollars. But for the great number of railroads, river steamers, and sea-going vessels (from Texas ports) engaged in carrying this product, it would have cut an important figure in the commerce of the country, but owing to the many interests between which it was divided it attracted little attention. _Meat._--The amount of fresh buffalo meat cured and marketed was really very insignificant. So long as it was to be had at all it was so very abundant that it was worth only from 2 to 3 cents per pound in the market, and many reasons combined to render the trade in fresh buffalo meat anything but profitable. Probably not more than one one-thousandth of the buffalo meat that might have been saved and utilized was saved. The buffalo carcasses that were wasted on the great plains every year during the two great periods of slaughter (of the northern and southern herds) would probably have fed to satiety during the entire time more than a million persons. As to the quality of buffalo meat, it may be stated in general terms that it differs in no way whatever from domestic beef of the same age produced by the same kind of grass. Perhaps there is no finer grazing ground in the world than Montana, and the beef it produces is certainly entitled to rank with the best. There are many persons who claim to recognize a difference between the taste of buffalo meat and domestic beef; but for my part I do not believe any difference really exists, unless it is that the flesh of the buffalo is a little sweeter and more juicy. As for myself, I feel certain I could not tell the difference between the flesh of a three-year old buffalo and that of a domestic beef of the same age, nor do I believe any one else could, even on a wager. Having once seen a butcher eat an elephant steak in the belief that it was beef from his own shop, and another butcher eat _loggerhead turtle_ steak for beef, I have become somewhat skeptical in regard to the intelligence of the human palate. As a matter of experiment, during our hunt for buffalo we had buffalo meat of all ages, from one year up to eleven, cooked in as many different ways as our culinary department could turn out. We had it broiled, fried with batter, roasted, boiled, and stewed. The last method, when employed upon slices of meat that had been hacked from a frozen hind-quarter, produced results that were undeniably tough and not particularly good. But it was an unfair way to cook any kind of meat, and may be guarantied to spoil the finest beef in the world. Hump meat from a cow buffalo not too old, cut in slices and fried in batter, _a la cowboy_, is delicious--a dish fit for the gods. We had tongues in plenty, but the ordinary meat was so good they were not half appreciated. Of course the tenderloin was above criticism, and even the round steaks, so lightly esteemed by the epicure, were tender and juicy to a most satisfactory degree. It has been said that the meat of the buffalo has a coarser texture or \"grain\" than domestic beef. Although I expected to find such to be the case, I found no perceptible difference whatever, nor do I believe that any exists. As to the distribution of fat I am unable to say, for the reason that our buffaloes were not fat. It is highly probable that the distribution of fat through the meat, so characteristic of the shorthorn breeds, and which has been brought about only by careful breeding, is not found in either the beef of the buffalo or common range cattle. In this respect, shorthorn beef no doubt surpasses both the others mentioned, but in all other points, texture, flavor, and general tenderness, I am very sure it does not. It is a great mistake for a traveler to kill a patriarchal old bull buffalo, and after attempting to masticate a small portion of him to rise up and declare that buffalo meat is coarse, tough, and dry. A domestic bull of the same age would taste as tough. It is probably only those who have had the bad taste to eat bull-beef who have ever found occasion to asperse the reputation of _Bison americanus_ as a beef animal. Until people got tired of them, buffalo tongues were in considerable demand, and hundreds, if not even thousands, of barrels of them were shipped east from the buffalo country. _Pemmican._--Out of the enormous waste of good buffalo flesh one product stands forth as a redeeming feature--pemmican. Although made almost exclusively by the half-breeds and Indians of the Northwest it constituted a regular article of commerce of great value to overland travelers, and was much sought for as long as it was produced. Its peculiar \"staying powers,\" due to the process of its manufacture, which yielded a most nourishing food in a highly condensed form, made it of inestimable value to the overland traveler who must travel light or not at all. A handful of pemmican was sufficient food to constitute a meal when provisions were at all scarce. The price of pemmican in Winnipeg was once as low as 2d. per pound, but in 1883 a very small quantity which was brought in sold at 10 cents per pound. This was probably the last buffalo pemmican made. H. M. Robinson states that in 1878 pemmican was worth 1s. 3d. per pound. The manufacture of pemmican, as performed by the Red River half-breeds, was thus described by the Rev. Mr. Belcourt, a Catholic priest, who once accompanied one of the great buffalo-hunting expeditions:[45] [Note 45: Schoolcraft\\'s History, Condition and Prospects of the Indian Tribes, iv, p. 107.] \"Other portions which are destined to be made into pimikehigan, or pemmican, are exposed to an ardent heat, and thus become brittle and easily reducible to small particles by the use of a flail, the buffalo-hide answering the purpose of a threshing-floor. The fat or tallow, being cut up and melted in large kettles of sheet iron, is poured upon this pounded meat, and the whole mass is worked together with shovels until it is well amalgamated, when it is pressed, while still warm, into bags made of buffalo skin, which are strongly sewed up, and the mixture gradually cools and becomes almost as hard as a rock. If the fat used in this process is that taken from the parts containing the udder, the meat is called fine pemmican. In some cases, dried fruits, such as the prairie pear and cherry, are intermixed, which forms what is called seed pemmican. Tho lovers of good eating judge the first described to be very palatable; the second, better; the third, excellent. A taurean of pemmican weighs from 100 to 110 pounds. Some idea may be formed of the immense destruction of buffalo by these people when it is stated that a whole cow yields one-half a bag of pemmican and three fourths of a bundle of dried meat; so that the most economical calculate that from eight to ten cows are required for the load of a single vehicle.\" It is quite evident from the testimony of disinterested travelers that ordinary pemmican was not very palatable to one unaccustomed to it as a regular article of food. To the natives, however, especially the Canadian _voyageur_, it formed one of the most valuable food products of the country, and it is said that the demand for it was generally greater than the supply. _Dried, or \"jerked\" meat._--The most popular and universal method of curing buffalo meat was to cut it into thin flakes, an inch or less in thickness and of indefinite length, and without salting it in the least to hang it over poles, ropes, wicker-frames, or even clumps of standing sage brush, and let it dry in the sun. This process yielded the famous \"jerked\" meat so common throughout the West in the early days, from the Rio Grande to the Saskatchewan. Father Belcourt thus described the curing process as it was practiced by the half-breeds and Indians of the Northwest: \"The meat, when taken to camp, is cut by the women into long strips about a quarter of an inch thick, which are hung upon the lattice-work prepared for that purpose to dry. This lattice-work is formed of small pieces of wood, placed horizontally, transversely, and equidistant from each other, not unlike an immense gridiron, and is supported by wooden uprights (trepieds). In a few days the meat is thoroughly desiccated, when it is bent into proper lengths and tied into bundles of 60 or 70 pounds weight. This is called dried meat (viande seche). To make the hide into parchment (so called) it is stretched on a frame, and then scraped on the inside with a piece of sharpened bone and on the outside with a small but sharp-curved iron, proper to remove the hair. This is considered, likewise, the appropriate labor of women. The men break the bones, which are boiled in water to extract the marrow to be used for frying and other culinary purposes. The oil is then poured into the bladder of the animal, which contains, when filled, about 12 pounds, being the yield of the marrow-bones of two buffaloes.\" In the Northwest Territories dried meat, which formerly sold at 2_d._ per pound, was worth in 1878 10_d._ per pound. Although I have myself prepared quite a quantity of jerked buffalo meat, I never learned to like it. Owing to the absence of salt in its curing, the dried meat when pounded and made into a stew has a \"far away\" taste which continually reminds one of hoofs and horns. For all that, and despite its resemblance in flavor to Liebig\\'s Extract of Beef, it is quite good, and better to the taste than ordinary pemmican. The Indians formerly cured great quantities of buffalo meat in this way--in summer, of course, for use in winter--but the advent of that popular institution called \"Government beef\" long ago rendered it unnecessary for the noble red man to exert his squaw in that once honorable field of labor. During the existence of the buffalo herds a few thrifty and enterprising white men made a business of killing buffaloes in summer and drying the meat in bulk, in the same manner which to-day produces our popular \"dried beef.\" Mr. Allen states that \"a single hunter at Hays City shipped annually for some years several hundred barrels thus prepared, which the consumers probably bought for ordinary beef.\" _Uses of bison\\'s hair._--Numerous attempts have been made to utilize the woolly hair of the bison in the manufacture of textile fabrics. As early as 1729 Col. William Byrd records the fact that garments were made of this material, as follows: \"The Hair growing upon his Head and Neck is long and Shagged, and so Soft that it will spin into Thread not unlike Mohair, and might be wove into a sort of Camlet. Some People have Stockings knit of it, that would have served an Israelite during his forty Years march thro\\' the Wilderness.\"[46] [Note 46: Westover MSS., i, p. 172.] In 1637 Thomas Morton published, in his \"New English Canaan,\" p. 98,[47] the following reference to the Indians who live on the southern shore of Lake Erocoise, supposed to be Lake Ontario: [Note 47: Quoted by Professor Allen, \"American Bisons,\" p. 107.] \"These Beasts [buffaloes, undoubtedly] are of the bignesse of a Cowe, their flesh being very good foode, their hides good lether, their fleeces very usefull, being a kind of wolle, as fine as the wolle of the Beaver, and the Salvages doe make garments thereof.\" Professor Allen quotes a number of authorities who have recorded statements in regard to the manufacture of belts, garters, scarfs, sacks, etc., from buffalo wool by various tribes of Indians.[48] He also calls attention to the only determined efforts ever made by white men on a liberal scale for the utilization of buffalo \"wool\" and its manufacture into cloth, an account of which appears in Ross\\'s \"Red River Settlement,\" pp. 69-72. In 1821 some of the more enterprising of the Red River (British) colonists conceived the idea of making fortunes out of the manufacture of woolen goods from the fleece of the buffalo, and for that purpose organized the Buffalo Wool Company, the principal object of which was declared to be \"to provide a substitute for wool, which substitute was to be the wool of the wild buffalo, which was to be collected in the plains and manufactured both for the use of the colonists and for export.\" A large number of skilled workmen of various kinds were procured from England, and also a plant of machinery and materials. When too late, it was found that the supply of buffalo wool obtainable was utterly insufficient, the raw wool costing the company 1_s._ 6_d._ per pound, and cloth which it cost the company £2 10_s._ per yard to produce was worth only 4_s._ 6_d._ per yard in England. The historian states that universal drunkenness on the part of all concerned aided very materially in bringing about the total failure of the enterprise in a very short time. [Note 48: The American Bison, p. 197.] While it is possible to manufacture the fine, woolly fur of the bison into cloth or knitted garments, provided a sufficient supply of the raw material could be obtained (which is and always has been impossible), nothing could be more visionary than an attempt to thus produce salable garments at a profit. Articles of wearing apparel made of buffalo\\'s hair are interesting as curiosities, for their rarity makes them so, but that is the only end they can ever serve so long as there is a sheep living. In the National Museum, in the section of animal products, there is displayed a pair of stockings made in Canada from the finest buffalo wool, from the body of the animal. They are thick, heavy, and full of the coarse, straight hairs, which it seems can never be entirely separated from the fine wool. In general texture they are as coarse as the coarsest sheep\\'s wool would produce. With the above are also displayed a rope-like lariat, made by the Comanche Indians, and a smaller braided lasso, seemingly a sample more than a full-grown lariat, made by the Otoe Indians of Nebraska. Both of the above are made of the long, dark-brown hair of the head and shoulders, and in spite of the fact that they have been twisted as hard as possible, the ends of the hairs protrude so persistently that the surface of each rope is extremely hairy. _Buffalo chips._--Last, but by no means least in value to the traveler on the treeless plains, are the droppings of the buffalo, universally known as \"buffalo chips.\" When over one year old and thoroughly dry, this material makes excellent fuel. Usually it occurs only where fire-wood is unobtainable, and thousands of frontiersmen have a million times found it of priceless value. When dry, it catches easily, burns readily, and makes a hot fire with but very little smoke, although it is rapidly consumed. Although not as good for a fire as even the poorest timber it is infinitely better than sage-brush, which, in the absence of chips, is often the traveler\\'s last resort. It usually happens that chips are most-abundant in the sheltered creek-bottoms and near the water-holes, the very situations which travelers naturally select for their camps. In these spots the herds have gathered either for shelter in winter or for water in summer, and remained in a body for some hours. And now, when the cowboy on the round-up, the surveyor, or hunter, who must camp out, pitches his tent in the grassy coulée or narrow creek-bottom, his first care is to start out with his largest gunning bag to \"rustle some buffalo chips\" for a campfire. He, at least, when he returns well laden with the spoil of his humble chase, still has good reason to remember the departed herd with feelings of gratitude. Thus even the last remains of this most useful animal are utilized by man in providing for his own imperative wants. IX. THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE BISON TO CATTLE-GROWERS. _The bison in captivity and domestication._--Almost from time immemorial it has been known that the American bison takes kindly to captivity, herds contentedly with domestic cattle, and crosses with them with the utmost readiness. It was formerly believed, and indeed the tradition prevails even now to quite an extent, that on account of the hump on the shoulders a domestic cow could not give birth to a half-breed calf. This belief is entirely without foundation, and is due to theories rather than facts. Numerous experiments in buffalo breeding have been made, and the subject is far from being a new one. As early as 1701 the Huguenot settlers at Manikintown, on the James River, a few miles above Richmond, began to domesticate buffaloes. It is also a matter of historical record that in 1786, or thereabouts, buffaloes were domesticated and bred in captivity in Virginia, and Albert Gallatin states that in some of the northwestern counties the mixed breed was quite common. In 1815 a series of elaborate and valuable experiments in cross-breeding the buffalo and domestic cattle was begun by Mr. Robert Wickliffe, of Lexington, Ky., and continued by him for upwards of thirty years.[49] [Note 49: For a full account of Mr. Wickliffe\\'s experiments, written by himself, see Audubon and Bachman\\'s \"Quadrupeds of North America,\" vol. ii, pp. 52-54.] Quite recently the buffalo-breeding operations of Mr. S. L. Bedson, of Stony Mountain, Manitoba, and Mr. C. J. Jones, of Garden City, Kans., have attracted much attention, particularly for the reason that the efforts of both these gentlemen have been directed toward the practical improvement of the present breeds of range cattle. For this reason the importance of the work in which they are engaged can hardly be overestimated, and the results already obtained by Mr. Bedson, whose experiments antedate those of Mr. Jones by several years, are of the greatest interest to western cattle-growers. Indeed, unless the stock of pure-blood buffaloes now remaining proves insufficient for the purpose, I fully believe that we will gradually see a great change wrought in the character of western cattle by the introduction of a strain of buffalo blood. The experiments which have been made thus far prove conclusively that-- (1) The male bison crosses readily with the opposite sex of domestic cattle, but a buffalo cow has never been known to produce a half-breed calf. (2) The domestic cow produces a half-breed calf successfully. (3) The progeny of the two species is fertile to any extent, yielding half-breeds, quarter, three-quarter breeds, and so on. (4) The bison breeds in captivity with perfect regularity and success. _Need of an improvement in range cattle._--Ever since the earliest days of cattle-ranching in the West, stockmen have had it in their power to produce a breed which would equal in beef-bearing qualities the best breeds to be found upon the plains, and be so much better calculated to survive the hardships of winter, that their annual losses would have been very greatly reduced. Whenever there is an unusually severe winter, such as comes about three times in every decade, if not even oftener, range cattle perish by thousands. It is an absolute impossibility for every ranchman who owns several thousand, or even several hundred, head of cattle to provide hay for them, even during the severest portion of the winter season, and consequently the cattle must depend wholly upon their own resources. When the winter is reasonably mild, and the snows never very deep, nor lying too long at a time on the ground, the cattle live through the winter with very satisfactory success. Thanks to the wind, it usually happens that the falling snow is blown off the ridges as fast as it falls, leaving the grass sufficiently uncovered for the cattle to feed upon it. If the snow-fall is universal, but not more than a few inches in depth, the cattle paw through it here and there, and eke out a subsistence, on quarter rations it may be, until a friendly chinook wind sets in from the southwest and dissolves the snow as if by magic in a few hours\\' time. But when a deep snow comes, and lies on the ground persistently, week in and week out, when the warmth of the sun softens and moistens its surface sufficiently for a returning cold wave to freeze it into a hard crust, forming a universal wall of ice between the luckless steer and his only food, the cattle starve and freeze in immense numbers. Being totally unfitted by nature to survive such unnatural conditions, it is not strange that they succumb. Under present conditions the stockman simply stakes his cattle against the winter elements and takes his chances on the results, which are governed by circumstances wholly beyond his control. The losses of the fearful winter of 1886-\\'87 will probably never be forgotten by the cattlemen of the great Western grazing ground. In many portions of Montana and Wyoming the cattlemen admitted a loss of 50 per cent of their cattle, and in some localities the loss was still greater. The same conditions are liable to prevail next winter, or any succeeding winter, and we may yet see more than half the range cattle in the West perish in a single month. Yet all this time the cattlemen have had it in their power, by the easiest and simplest method in the world, to introduce a strain of hardy native blood in their stock which would have made it capable of successfully resisting a much greater degree of hunger and cold. It is really surprising that the desirability of cross-breeding the buffalo and domestic cattle should for so long a time have been either overlooked or disregarded. While cattle-growers generally have shown the greatest enterprise in producing special breeds for milk, for butter, or for beef, cattle with short horns and cattle with no horns at all, only two or three men have had the enterprise to try to produce a breed particularly hardy and capable. A buffalo can weather storms and outlive hunger and cold which would kill any domestic steer that ever lived. When nature placed him on the treeless and blizzard-swept plains, she left him well equipped to survive whatever natural conditions he would have to encounter. The most striking feature of his entire _tout ensemble_ is his magnificent suit of hair and fur combined, the warmest covering possessed by any quadruped save the musk-ox. The head, neck, and fore quarters are clothed with hide and hair so thick as to be almost, if not entirely, impervious to cold. The hair on the body and hind quarters is long, fine, very thick, and of that peculiar woolly quality which constitutes the best possible protection against cold. Let him who doubts the warmth of a good buffalo robe try to weather a blizzard with something else, and then try the robe. The very form of the buffalo--short, thick legs, and head hung very near the ground--suggests most forcibly a special fitness to wrestle with mother earth for a living, snow or no snow. A buffalo will flounder for days through deep snow-drifts without a morsel of food, and survive where the best range steer would literally freeze on foot, bolt upright, as hundreds did in the winter of 1886-\\'87. While range cattle turn tail to a blizzard and drift helplessly, the buffalo faces it every time, and remains master of the situation. It has for years been a surprise to me that Western stockmen have not seized upon the opportunity presented by the presence of the buffalo to improve the character of their cattle. Now that there are no longer any buffalo calves to be had on the plains for the trouble of catching them, and the few domesticated buffaloes that remain are worth fabulous prices, we may expect to see a great deal of interest manifested in this subject, and some costly efforts made to atone for previous lack of forethought. _The character of the buffalo-domestic hybrid._--The subjoined illustration from a photograph kindly furnished by Mr. C. J. Jones, represents a ten months\\' old half-breed calf (male), the product of a buffalo bull and domestic cow. The prepotency of the sire is apparent at the first glance, and to so marked an extent that the illustration would pass muster anywhere as having been drawn from a full-blood buffalo. The head, neck, and hump, and the long woolly hair that covers them, proclaim the buffalo in every line. Excepting that the hair on the shoulders (below the hump) is of the same length as that on the body and hind quarters, there is, so far as one can judge from an excellent photograph, no difference whatever observable between this lusty young half-breed and a full blood buffalo calf of the same age and sex. Mr. Jones describes the color of this animal as \"iron-gray,\" and remarks: \"You will see how even the fur is, being as long on the hind parts as on the shoulders and neck, very much unlike the buffalo, which is so shaggy about the shoulders and so thin farther back.\" Upon this point it is to be remarked that the hair on the body of a yearling or two year-old buffalo is always very much longer in proportion to the hair on the forward parts than it is later in life, and while the shoulder hair is always decidedly longer than that back of it, during the first two years the contrast is by no means so very great. A reference to the memoranda of hair measurements already given will afford precise data on this point. In regard to half-breed calves, Mr. Bedson states in a private letter that \"the hump does not appear until several months after birth.\" Altogether, the male calf described above so strongly resembles a pure-blood buffalo as to be generally mistaken for one; the form of the adult half-blood cow promptly proclaims her origin. The accompanying plate, also from a photograph supplied by Mr. Jones, accurately represents a half-breed cow, six years old, weighing about 1,800 pounds. Her body is very noticeably larger in proportion than that of the cow buffalo, her pelvis much heavier, broader, and more cow-like, therein being a decided improvement upon the small and weak hind quarters of the wild species. The hump is quite noticeable, but is not nearly so high as in the pure buffalo cow. The hair on the fore quarters, neck, and head is decidedly shorter, especially on the head; the frontlet and chin beard being conspicuously lacking. The tufts of long, coarse, black hair which clothe the fore-arm of the buffalo cow are almost absent, but apparently the hair on the body and hind quarters has lost but little, if any, of its length, density, and fine, furry quality. The horns are decidedly cow-like in their size, length, and curvature. [Illustration: HALF-BREED (BUFFALO-DOMESTIC) CALF.--HERD OF C. J. JONES, GARDEN CITY, KANSAS. Drawn by Ernest E. Thompson.] Regarding the general character of the half-breed buffalo, and his herd in general, Mr. Bedson writes me as follows, in a letter dated September 12, 1888: \"The nucleus of my herd consisted of a young buffalo bull and four heifer calves, which I purchased in 1877, and the increase from these few has been most rapid, as will be shown by a tabular statement farther on. \"Success with the breeding of the pure buffalo was followed by experiments in crossing with the domestic animal. This crossing has generally been between a buffalo bull and an ordinary cow, and with the most encouraging results, since it had been contended by many that although the cow might breed a calf from the buffalo, yet it would be at the expense of her life, owing to the hump on a buffalo\\'s shoulder; but this hump does not appear until several months after birth. This has been proved a fallacy respecting _this herd_ at least, for calving has been attended with no greater percentage of losses than would be experienced in ranching with the ordinary cattle. Buffalo cows and crosses have dropped calves at as low a temperature as 20° below zero, and the calves were sturdy and healthy. \"The half breed resulting from the cross as above mentioned has been again crossed with the thoroughbred buffalo bull, producing a three quarter breed animal closely resembling the buffalo, the head and robe being quite equal, if not superior. The half-breeds are very prolific. The cows drop a calf annually. They are also very hardy indeed, as they take the instinct of the buffalo during the blizzards and storms, and do not drift like native cattle. They remain upon the open prairie during our severest winters, while the thermometer ranges from 30 to 40 degrees below zero, with little or no food except what they rustled on the prairie, and no shelter at all. In nearly all the ranching parts of North America foddering and housing of cattle is imperative in a more or less degree,[50] creating an item of expense felt by all interested in cattle-raising; but the buffalo [half]breed retains all its native hardihood, needs no housing, forages in the deepest snows for its own food, yet becomes easily domesticated, and consequently needs but little herding. Therefore the progeny of the buffalo is easily reared, cheaply fed, and requires no housing in winter; three very essential points in stock-raising. [Note 50: On nearly all the great cattle ranches of the United States it is absolutely impossible, and is not even attempted.--W. T. H.] \"They are always in good order, and I consider the meat of the half-breed much preferable to domestic animals, while the robe is very fine indeed, the fur being evened up on the hind parts, the same as on the shoulders. During the history of the herd, accident and other causes have compelled the slaughtering of one or two, and in these instances the carcasses have sold for 18 cents per pound; the hides in their dressed state for $50 to $75 each. A half-breed buffalo ox (four years old, crossed with buffalo bull and Durham cow) was killed last winter, and weighed 1,280 pounds dressed beef. One pure buffalo bull now in my herd weighs fully 2,000 pounds, and a [half]breed bull 1,700 to 1,800 pounds. \"The three-quarter breed is an enormous animal in size, and has an extra good robe, which will readily bring $40 to $50 in any market where there is a demand for robes. They are also very prolific, and I consider them the coming cattle for our range cattle for the Northern climate, while the half and quarter breeds will be the animals for the more Southern district. The half and three-quarter breed cows, when really matured, will weigh from 1,400 to 1,800 pounds. \"I have never crossed them except with a common grade of cows, while I believe a cross with the Galloways would produce the handsomest robe ever handled, and make the best range cattle in the world. I have not had time to give my attention to my herd, more than to let them range on the prairies at will. By proper care great results can be accomplished.\" Hon. C. J. Jones, of Garden City, Kans., whose years of experience with the buffalo, both as old-time hunter, catcher, and breeder, has earned for him the sobriquet of \"Buffalo Jones,\" five years ago became deeply interested in the question of improving range cattle by crossing with the buffalo. With characteristic Western energy he has pursued the subject from that time until the present, having made five trips to the range of the only buffaloes remaining from the great southern herd, and captured sixty-eight buffalo calves and eleven adult cows with which to start a herd. In a short article published in the Farmers\\' Review (Chicago, August 22, 1888), Mr. Jones gives his views on the value of the buffalo in cross-breeding as follows: \"In all my meanderings I have not found a place but I could count more carcasses [of cattle] than living animals. Who has not ridden over some of the Western railways and counted dead cattle by the thousands? The great question is, Where can we get a race of cattle that will stand blizzards, and endure the drifting snow, and will not be driven with the storms against the railroad fences and pasture fences, there to perish for the want of nerve to face the northern winds for a few miles, to where the winter grasses could be had in abundance? Realizing these facts, both from observation and pocket, we pulled on our \\'thinking cap,\\' and these points came vividly to our mind: \"(1) We want an animal that is hardy. \"(2) We want an animal with nerve and endurance. \"(3) We want an animal that faces the blizzards and endures the storms. \"(4) We want an animal that will rustle the prairies, and not yield to discouragement. \"(5) We want an animal that will fill the above bill, and make good beef and plenty of it. [Illustration: HALF-BREED (BUFFALO-DOMESTIC) COW.--HERD OF C. J. JONES, GARDEN CITY, KANSAS. Drawn by Ernest E. Thompson.] \"All the points above could easily be found in the buffalo, excepting the fifth, and even that is more than filled as to the quality, but not in quantity. Where is the \\'old timer\\' who has not had a cut from the hump or sirloin of a fat buffalo cow in the fall of the year, and where is the one who will not make affidavit that it was the best meat he ever ate? Yes, the fat was very rich, equal to the marrow from the bone of domestic cattle. * * * \"The great question remained unsolved as to the quantity of meat from the buffalo. I finally heard of a half-breed buffalo in Colorado, and immediately set out to find it. I traveled at least 1,000 miles to find it, and found a five-year-old half-breed cow that had been bred to domestic bulls and had brought forth two calves--a yearling and a sucking calf that gave promise of great results. \"The cow had never been fed, but depended altogether on the range, and when I saw her, in the fall of 1883. I estimated her weight at 1,800 pounds. She was a brindle, and had a handsome robe even in September; she had as good hind quarters as ordinary cattle; her foreparts were heavy and resembled the buffalo, yet not near so much of the hump. The offspring showed but very little of the buffalo, yet they possessed a woolly coat, which showed clearly that they were more than domestic cattle. * * * \"What we can rely on by having one-fourth, one-half, and three-fourths breeds might be analyzed as follows: \"We can depend upon a race of cattle unequaled in the world for hardiness and durability; a good meat-bearing animal; the best and only fur-bearing animal of the bovine race; the animal always found in a storm where it is overtaken by it; a race of cattle so clannish as never to separate and go astray; the animal that can always have free range, as they exist where no other animal can live; the animal that can water every third day and keep fat, ranging from 20 to 30 miles from water; in fact, they are the perfect animal for the plains of North America. One-fourth breeds for Texas, one-half breeds for Colorado and Kansas, and three-fourths breeds for more northern country, is what will soon be sought after more than any living animal. Then we will never be confronted with dead carcarsses from starvation, exhaustion, and lack of nerve, as in years gone by.\" _The bison as a beast of burden._--On account of the abundance of horses for all purposes throughout the entire country, oxen are so seldom used they almost constitute a curiosity. There never has existed a necessity to break buffaloes to the yoke and work them like domestic oxen, and so few experiments have been made in this direction that reliable data on this subject is almost wholly wanting. While at Miles City, Mont., I heard of a German \"granger\" who worked a small farm in the Tongue River Valley, and who once had a pair of cow buffaloes trained to the yoke. It was said that they were strong, rapid walkers, and capable of performing as much work as the best domestic oxen, but they were at times so uncontrollably headstrong and obstinate as to greatly detract from their usefulness. The particular event of their career on which their historian dwelt with special interest occurred when their owner was hauling a load of potatoes to town with them. In the course of the long drive the buffaloes grew very thirsty, and upon coming within sight of the water in the river they started for it in a straight course. The shouts and blows of the driver only served to hasten their speed, and presently, when they reached the edge of the high bank, they plunged down it without the slightest hesitation, wagon, potatoes, and all, to the loss of everything except themselves and the drink they went after! Mr. Robert Wickliffe states that trained buffaloes make satisfactory oxen. \"I have broken them to the yoke, and found them capable of making excellent oxen; and for drawing wagons, carts, or other heavily laden vehicles on long journeys they would, I think, be greatly preferable to the common ox.\" It seems probable that, in the absence of horses, the buffalo would make a much more speedy and enduring draught animal than the domestic ox, although it is to be doubted whether he would be as strong. His weaker pelvis and hind quarters would surely count against him under certain circumstances, but for some purposes his superior speed and endurance would more than counterbalance that defect. BISON HERDS AND INDIVIDUALS IN CAPTIVITY AND DOMESTICATION, JANUARY 1, 1889. _Herd of Mr. S. L. Bedson, Stony Mountain, Manitoba._--In 1877 Mr. Bedson purchased 5 buffalo calves, 1 bull, and 4 heifers, for which he paid $1,000. In 1888 his herd consisted of 23 full-blood bulls, 35 cows, 3 half-breed cows, 5 half-breed bulls, and 17 calves, mixed and pure;[51] making a total of 83 head. These were all produced from the original 5, no purchases having been made, nor any additions made in any other way. Besides the 83 head constituting the herd when it was sold, 5 were killed and 9 given away, which would otherwise make a total of 97 head produced since 1877. In November, 1888, this entire herd was purchased, for $50,000, by Mr. C. J. Jones, and added to the already large herd owned by that gentleman in Kansas. [Note 51: In summing up the total number of buffaloes and mixed-breeds now alive in captivity, I have been obliged to strike an average on this lot of calves \"mixed and pure,\" and have counted twelve as being of pure breed and five mixed, which I have reason to believe is very near the truth.] [Illustration: YOUNG HALF-BREED (BUFFALO-DOMESTIC) BULL.--HERD OF C. J. JONES, GARDEN CITY, KANSAS. Drawn by Ernest E. Thompson.] _Herd of Mr. C. J. Jones, Garden City, Kans._--Mr. Jones\\'s original herd of 57 buffaloes constitute a living testimonial to his individual enterprise, and to his courage, endurance, and skill in the chase. The majority of the individuals composing the herd he himself ran down, lassoed, and tied with his own hands. For the last five years Mr. Jones has made an annual trip, in June, to the uninhabited \"panhandle\" of Texas, to capture calves out of the small herd of from one hundred to two hundred head which represented the last remnant of the great southern herd. Each of these expeditious involved a very considerable outlay in money, an elaborate \"outfit\" of men, horses, vehicles, camp equipage, and lastly, but most important of all, a herd of a dozen fresh milch cows to nourish the captured calves and keep them from dying of starvation and thirst. The region visited was fearfully barren, almost without water, and to penetrate it was always attended by great hardship. The buffaloes were difficult to find, but the ground was good for running, being chiefly level plains, and the superior speed of the running horses always enabled the hunters to overtake a herd whenever one was sighted, and to \"cut out\" and lasso two, three, or four of its calves. The degree of skill and daring displayed in these several expeditions are worthy of the highest admiration, and completely surpass anything I have ever seen or read of being accomplished in connection with hunting, or the capture of live game. The latest feat of Mr. Jones and his party comes the nearest to being incredible. During the month of May, 1888, they not only captured seven calves, but also _eleven adult cows_, of which some were lassoed in full career on the prairie, thrown, tied, and hobbled! The majority, however, were actually \"rounded up,\" herded, and held in control until a bunch of tame buffaloes was driven down to meet them, so that it would thus be possible to drive all together to a ranch. This brilliant feat can only be appreciated as it deserves by those who have lately hunted buffalo, and learned by dear experience the extent of their wariness, and the difficulties, to say nothing of the dangers, inseparably connected with their pursuit. The result of each of Mr. Jones\\'s five expeditions is as follows: In 1884 no calves found; 1885, 11 calves captured, 5 died, 6 survived; 1886, 14 calves captured, 7 died, 7 survived; 1887, 36 calves captured, 6 died, 30 survived; 1888, 7 calves captured, all survived; 1888, 11 old cows captured, all survived. Total, 79 captures, 18 losses, 57 survivors. The census of the herd is exactly as follows: Adult cows, 11; three-year olds, 7, of which 2 are males and 5 females; two-year olds, 4, of which all are males; yearling, 28, of which 15 are males and 13 females; calves, 7, of which 3 are males and 4 females. Total herd, 57; 24 males and 33 females. To this, Mr. Jones\\'s original herd, must now be added the entire herd formerly owned by Mr. Bedson. Respecting his breeding operations Mr. Jones writes: \"My oldest [bull] buffaloes are now three years old, and I am breeding one hundred domestic cows to them this year. Am breeding the Galloway cows quite extensively; also some Shorthorns, Herefords, and Texas cows. I expect best results from the Galloways. If I can get the black luster of the latter and the fur of a buffalo, I will have a robe that will bring more money than we get for the average range steer.\" In November, 1888, Mr. Jones purchased Mr. Bedson\\'s entire herd, and in the following mouth proceeded to ship a portion of it to Kansas City. Thirty-three head were separated from the remainder of the herd on the prairie near Stony Mountain, 12 miles from Winnipeg, and driven to the railroad. Several old bulls broke away en route and ran back to the herd, and when the remainder were finally corraled in the pens at the stock-yards \"they began to fight among themselves, and some fierce encounters were waged between the old bulls. The younger cattle were raised on the horns of their seniors, thrown in the air, and otherwise gored.\" While on the way to St. Paul three of the half-breed buffaloes were killed by their companions. On reaching Kansas City and unloading the two cars, 13 head broke away from the large force of men that attempted to manage them, stampeded through the city, and finally took refuge in the low-lands along the river. In due time, however, all were recaptured. Since the acquisition of this northern herd and the subsequent press comment that it has evoked, Mr. Jones has been almost overwhelmed with letters of inquiry in regard to the whole subject of buffalo breeding, and has found it necessary to print and distribute a circular giving answers to the many inquiries that have been made. _Herd of Mr. Charles Allard, Flathead Indian Reservation, Montana._--This herd was visited in the autumn of 1888 by Mr. G. O. Shields, of Chicago, who reports that it consists of thirty-five head of pure-blood buffaloes, of which seven are calves of 1888, six are yearlings, and six are two-year olds. Of the adult animals, four cows and two bulls are each fourteen years old, \"and the beards of the bulls almost sweep the ground as they walk.\" _Herd of Hon. W. F. Cody (\"Buffalo Bill\")._--The celebrated \"Wild West Show\" has, ever since its organization, numbered amongst its leading attractions a herd of live buffaloes of all ages. At present this herd contains eighteen head, of which fourteen were originally purchased of Mr. H. T. Groome, of Wichita, Kansas, and have made a journey to London and back. As a proof of the indomitable persistence of the bison in breeding under most unfavorable circumstances, the fact that four of the members of this herd are calves which were born in 1888 in London, at the American Exposition, is of considerable interest. This herd is now (December, 1888) being wintered on General Beale\\'s farm, near the city of Washington. In 1886-\\'87, while the Wild West Show was at Madison Square Garden, New York City, its entire herd of twenty buffaloes was carried off by pleuro-pneumonia. It is to be greatly feared that sooner or later in the course of its travels the present herd will also disappear, either through disease or accident. _Herd of Mr. Charles Goodnight, Clarendon, Texas._--Mr. Goodnight writes that he has \"been breeding buffaloes in a small way for the past ten years,\" but without giving any particular attention to it. At present his herd consists of thirteen head, of which two are three-year old bulls and four are calves. There are seven cows of all ages, one of which is a half-breed. _Herd at the Zoological Society\\'s Gardens, Philadelphia, Arthur E. Brown, superintendent._--This institution is the fortunate possessor of a small herd of ten buffaloes, of which four are males and six females. Two are calves of 1877. In 1886 the Gardens sold an adult bull and cow to Hon. W. F. Cody for $300. _Herd at Bismarck Grove, Kansas, owned by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad Company._--A small herd of buffaloes has for several years past been kept at Bismarck Grove as an attraction to visitors. At present it contains ten head, one of which is a very large bull, another in a four-year-old bull, six are cows of various ages, and two are two-year olds. In 1885 a large bull belonging to this herd grew so vicious and dangerous that it was necessary to kill him. The following interesting account of this herd was published in the Kansas City Times of December 8, 1888: \"Thirteen years ago Colonel Stanton purchased a buffalo bull calf for $8 and two heifers for $25. The descendants of these three buffaloes now found at Bismarck Grove, where all were born, number in all ten. There were seventeen, but the rest have died, with the exception of one, which was given away. They are kept in an inclosure containing about 30 acres immediately adjoining the park, and there may be seen at any time. The sight is one well worth a trip and the slight expense that may attach to it, especially to one who has never seen the American bison in his native state. \"The present herd includes two fine bull calves dropped last spring, two heifers, five cows, and a bull six years old and as handsome as a picture. The latter has been named Cleveland, after the colonel\\'s favorite Presidential candidate. The entire herd is in as fine condition as any beef cattle, though they were never fed anything but hay and are never given any shelter. In fact they don\\'t take kindly to shelter, and whether a blizzard is blowing, with the mercury 20 degrees below zero, or the sun pouring down his scorching rays, with the thermometer 110 degrees above, they set their heads resolutely toward storm or sun and take their medicine as if they liked it. Hon. W. F. Cody, \"Buffalo Bill,\" tried to buy the whole herd two years ago to take to Europe with his Wild West Show, but they were not for sale at his own figures, and, indeed, there is no anxiety to dispose of them at any figures. The railroad company has been glad to furnish them pasturage for the sake of adding to the attractions of the park, in which there are also forty-three head of deer, including two as fine bucks as ever trotted over the national deer trail toward the salt-licks in northern Utah. \"While the bison at Bismark Grove are splendid specimens of their class, \"Cleveland\" is decidedly the pride of the herd, and as grand a creature as ever trod the soil of Kansas on four legs. He is just six years old and is a perfect specimen of the kings of the plains. There is royal blood in his veins, and his coat is finer than the imperial purple. It is not possible to get at him to measure his stature and weight. He must weigh fully 3,000 pounds, and it is doubtful if there is to-day living on the face of the earth a handsomer buffalo bull than he. \"Cleveland\\'s\" disposition is not so ugly as old Barney\\'s was, but at certain seasons he is very wild, and there is no one venturesome enough to go into the inclosure. It is then not altogether safe to even look over the high and heavy board fence at him, for he is likely to make a run for the visitor, as the numerous holes in the fence where he has knocked off the boards will testify.\" _Herd of Mr. Frederick Dupree, Cheyenne Indian Agency, near Fort Bennett, Dakota._--This herd contains at present nine pure-blood buffaloes, five of which are cows and seven mixed bloods. Of the former, there are two adult bulls and four adult cows. Of the mixed blood animals, six are half-breeds and one a quarter-breed buffalo. Mr. Dupree obtained the nucleus of his herd in 1882, at which time he captured five wild calves about 100 miles west of Fort Bennett. Of these, two died after two months of captivity and a third was killed by an Indian in 1885. Mr. D. F. Carlin, of the Indian service, at Fort Bennett, has kindly furnished me the following information respecting this herd, under date of November 1, 1888: \"The animals composing this herd are all in fine condition and are quite tame. They keep by themselves most of the time, except the oldest bull (six years old), who seems to appreciate the company of domestic cattle more than that of his own family. Mr. Dupree has kept one half-breed bull as an experiment; he thinks it will produce a hardy class of cattle. His half-breeds are all black, with one exception, and that is a roan; but they are all built like the buffalo, and when young they grunt more like a hog than like a calf, the same as a full-blood buffalo. \"Mr. Dupree has never lost a [domestic] cow in giving birth to a half-breed calf, as was supposed by many people would be the case. There have been no sales from this herd, although the owner has a standing offer of $650 for a cow and bull. The cows are not for sale at any price.\" _Herd at Lincoln Park, Chicago, Mr. W. P. Walker, superintendent._--This very interesting and handsomely-kept herd is composed of seven individuals of the following character: One bull eight years old, one bull four years old, two cows eight years old, two cows two years old in the spring of 1888, and one female calf born in the spring of 1888. _Zoological Gardens, Cincinnati, Ohio._--This collection contains four bison, an adult bull and cow, and one immature specimen. _Dr. V. T. McGillicuddy, Rapid City, Dakota_, has a herd of four pure buffaloes and one half-breed. Of the former, the two adults, a bull and cow seven years old, were caught by Sioux Indians near the Black Hills for the owner in the spring of 1882. The Indians drove two milch cows to the range to nourish the calves when caught. These have produced two calves, one of which, a bull, is now three years old, and the other is a yearling heifer. _Central Park Menagerie, New York, Dr. W. A. Conklin, director._--This much-visited collection contains four bison, an adult bull and cow, a two-year-old calf, and a yearling. _Mr. John H. Starin, Glen Inland, near New York City._--There are four buffaloes at this summer resort. _The U. S. National Museum, Washington, District of Columbia._--The collection of the department of living animals at this institution contains two fine young buffaloes; a bull four years old in July, 1888, and a cow three years old in May of the same year. These animals were captured in western Nebraska, when they were calves, by H. R. Jackett, of Ogalalla, and kept by him on his ranch until 1885. In April, 1888, Hon. Eugene G. Blackford, of New York, purchased them of Mr. Frederick D. Nowell, of North Platte, Nebraska, for $100 for the pair, and presented them to the National Museum, in the hope that they might form the nucleus of a herd to be owned and exhibited by the United States Government in or near the city of Washington. The two animals were received in Ogalalla by Mr. Joseph Palmer, of the National Museum, and by him they were brought on to Washington in May, in fine condition. Since their arrival they have been exhibited to the public in a temporary inclosure on the Smithsonian Grounds, and have attracted much attention. _Mr. B. C. Winston, of Hamline, Minnesota_, owns a pair of buffaloes, one of which, a young bull, was caught by him in western Dakota in the spring of 1886, soon after its birth. The cow was purchased at Rosseau, Dakota Territory, a year later, for $225. _Mr. I. P. Butler, of Colorado, Texas_, is the owner of a young bull buffalo and a half-breed calf. _Mr. Jesse Huston, of Miles City, Montana_, owns a fine five-year-old bull buffalo. _Mr. L. F. Gardner, of Bellwood, Oregon_, is the owner of a large adult bull. _The Riverside Ranch Company, south of Mandan, Dakota_, owns a pair of full-blood buffaloes. _In Dakota_, in the hands of parties unknown, there are four full-blood buffaloes. _Mr. James R. Hitch, of Optima, Indian Territory_, has a pair of young buffaloes, which he has offered for sale for $750. _Mr. Joseph A. Hudson, of Estell, Nebraska_, owns a three-year-old bull buffalo, which is for sale. In other countries there are live specimens of _Bison americanus_ reported as follows: two at Belleview Gardens, Manchester, England; one at the Zoological Gardens, London; one at Liverpool, England (purchased of Hon. W. F. Cody in 1888); two at the Zoological Gardens, Dresden; one at the Zoological Gardens, Calcutta. +--------------------------------------------------+ | _Statistics of full-blood buffaloes | | | in captivity January 1, 1889._ | | +---------------------------------------------+----+ |Number kept for breeding purposes | 216| |Number kept for exhibition | 40| | | ---| | Total pure-blood buffaloes in captivity | 256| |Wild buffaloes under Government | | |protection in the Yellowstone Park | 200| |Number of mixed-breed buffalo-domestics | 40| +--------------------------------------------------+ There are, without doubt, a few half-breeds in Manitoba of which I have no account. It is probable there are also a very few more captive buffaloes scattered singly here and there which will be heard of later, but the total will be a very small number, I am sure. PART II.--THE EXTERMINATION. I. CAUSES OF THE EXTERMINATION. The causes which led to the practical extinction (in a wild state, at least) of the most economically valuable wild animal that ever inhabited the American continent, are by no means obscure. It is well that we should know precisely what they were, and by the sad fate of the buffalo be warned in time against allowing similar causes to produce the same results with our elk, antelope, deer, moose, caribou, mountain sheep, mountain goat, walrus, and other animals. It will be doubly deplorable if the remorseless slaughter we have witnessed during the last twenty years carries with it no lessons for the future. A continuation of the record we have lately made as wholesale game butchers will justify posterity in dating us back with the mound-builders and cave-dwellers, when man\\'s only known function was to slay and eat. The primary cause of the buffalo\\'s extermination, and the one which embraced all others, was the descent of civilization, with all its elements of destructiveness, upon the whole of the country inhabited by that animal. From the Great Slave Lake to the Rio Grande the home of the buffalo was everywhere overrun by the man with a gun; and, as has ever been the case, the wild creatures were gradually swept away, the largest and most conspicuous forms being the first to go. The secondary causes of the extermination of the buffalo may be catalogued as follows: (1) Man\\'s reckless greed, his wanton destructiveness, and improvidence in not husbanding such resources as come to him from the hand of nature ready made. (2) The total and utterly inexcusable absence of protective measures and agencies on the part of the National Government and of the West States and Territories. (3) The fatal preference on the part of hunters generally, both white and red, for the robe and flesh of the cow over that furnished by the bull. (4) The phenomenal stupidity of the animals themselves, and their indifference to man. (5) The perfection of modern breech-loading rifles and other sporting fire-arms in general. Each of these causes acted against the buffalo with its fall force, to offset which there was _not even one_ restraining or preserving influence, and it is not to be wondered at that the species went down before them. Had any one of these conditions been eliminated the result would have been reached far less quickly. Had the buffalo, for example, possessed one-half the fighting qualities of the grizzly bear he would have fared very differently, but his inoffensiveness and lack of courage almost leads one to doubt the wisdom of the economy of nature so far as it relates to him. II. METHODS OF SLAUGHTER. 1. _The still-hunt._--Of all the deadly methods of buffalo slaughter, the still-hunt was the deadliest. Of all the methods that were unsportsmanlike, unfair, ignoble, and utterly reprehensible, this was in every respect the lowest and the worst. Destitute of nearly every element of the buoyant excitement and spice of danger that accompanied genuine buffalo hunting on horseback, the still-hunt was mere butchery of the tamest and yet most cruel kind. About it there was none of the true excitement of the chase; but there was plenty of greedy eagerness to \"down\" as many \"head\" as possible every day, just as there is in every slaughter-house where the killers are paid so much per head. Judging from all accounts, it was about as exciting and dangerous work as it would be to go out now and shoot cattle on the Texas or Montana ranges. The probabilities are, however, that shooting Texas cattle would be the most dangerous; for, instead of running from a man on foot, as the buffalo used to do, range cattle usually charge down upon him, from motives of curiosity, perhaps, and not infrequently place his life in considerable jeopardy. The buffalo owes his extermination very largely to his own unparalleled stupidity; for nothing else could by any possibility have enabled the still-hunters to accomplish what they did in such an incredibly short time. So long as the chase on horseback was the order of the day, it ordinarily required the united efforts of from fifteen to twenty-five hunters to kill a thousand buffalo in a single season; but a single still-hunter, with a long-range breech-loader, who knew how to make a \"sneak\" and get \"a stand on a bunch,\" often succeeded in killing from one to three thousand in one season by his own unaided efforts. Capt. Jack Brydges, of Kansas, who was one of the first to begin the final slaughter of the southern herd, killed, by contract, one thousand one hundred and forty-two buffaloes in six weeks. So long as the buffalo remained in large herds their numbers gave each individual a feeling of dependence upon his fellows and of general security from harm, even in the presence of strange phenomena which he could not understand. When he heard a loud report and saw a little cloud of white smoke rising from a gully, a clump of sage-brash, or the top of a ridge, 200 yards away, he wondered what it meant, and held himself in readiness to follow his leader in case she should run away. But when the leader of the herd, usually the oldest cow, fell bleeding upon the ground, and no other buffalo promptly assumed the leadership of the herd, instead of acting independently and fleeing from the alarm, he merely did as he saw the others do, and waited his turn to be shot. Latterly, however, when the herds were totally broken up, when the few survivors were scattered in every direction, and it became a case of every buffalo for himself, they became wild and wary, ever ready to start off at the slightest alarm, and run indefinitely. Had they shown the same wariness seventeen years ago that the survivors have manifested during the last three or four years, there would now be a hundred thousand head alive instead of only about three hundred in a wild and unprotected state. Notwithstanding the merciless war that had been waged against the buffalo for over a century by both whites and Indians, and the steady decrease of its numbers, as well as its range, there were several million head on foot, not only up to the completion of the Union Pacific Railway, but as late as the year 1870. Up to that time the killing done by white men had been chiefly for the sake of meat, the demand for robes was moderate, and the Indians took annually less than one hundred thousand for trading. Although half a million buffaloes were killed by Indians, half-breeds, and whites, the natural increase was so very considerable as to make it seem that the evil day of extermination was yet far distant. But by a coincidence which was fatal to the buffalo, with the building of three lines of railway through the most populous buffalo country there came a demand for robes and hides, backed up by an unlimited supply of new and marvellously accurate breech-loading rifles and fixed ammunition. And then followed a wild rush of hunters to the buffalo country, eager to destroy as many head as possible in the shortest time. For those greedy ones the chase on horseback was \"too slow\" and too unfruitful. That was a retail method of killing, whereas they wanted to kill by wholesale. From their point of view, the still-hunt or \"sneak\" hunt was the method _par excellence_. If they could have obtained Gatling guns with which to mow down a whole herd at a time, beyond a doubt they would have gladly used them. The still-hunt was seen at its very worst in the years 1871, 1872, and 1873, on the southern buffalo range, and ten years later at its best in Montana, on the northern. Let us first consider it at its best, which in principle was bad enough. The great rise in the price of robes which followed the blotting out of the great southern herd at once put buffalo-hunting on a much more comfortable and respectable business basis in the North than it had ever occupied in the South, where prices had all along been phenomenally low. In Montana it was no uncommon thing for a hunter to invest from $1,000 to $2,000 in his \"outfit\" of horses, wagons, weapons, ammunition, provisions, and sundries. One of the men who accompanied the Smithsonian Expedition for Buffalo, Mr. James McNaney, of Miles City, Montana, was an ex-buffalo banter, who had spent three seasons on the northern range, killing buffalo for their robes, and his standing as a hunter was of the best. A brief description of his outfit and its work during its last season on the range (1882-\\'83) may fairly be taken as a typical illustration of the life and work of the still-hunter at its best. The only thing against it was the extermination of the buffalo. During the winters of 1880 and 1881 Mr. McNaney had served in Maxwell\\'s outfit as a hunter, working by the month, but his success in killing was such that he decided to work the third year on his own account. Although at that time only seventeen years of age, he took an elder brother as a partner, and purchased an outfit in Miles City, of which the following were the principal items: Two wagons, 2 four-horse teams, 2 saddle-horses, 2 wall-tents, 1 cook-stove with pipe, 1 40-90 Sharp\\'s rifle (breech-loading), 1 45-70 Sharps rifle (breech-loading), 1 45-120 Sharps rifle (breech-loading), 50 pounds gunpowder, 550 pounds lead, 4,500 primers, 600 brass shells, 4 sheets patch-paper, 60 Wilson skinning knives, 3 butcher\\'s steels, 1 portable grindstone, flour, bacon, baking-powder, coffee, sugar, molasses, dried apples, canned vegetables, beans, etc., in quantity. The entire cost of the outfit was about $1,400. Two men were hired for the season at $50 per month, and the party started from Miles City on November 10, which was considered a very late start. The usual time of setting out for the range was about October 1. The outfit went by rail northeastward to Terry, and from thence across country south and east about 100 miles, around the head of O\\'Fallon Creek to the head of Beaver Creek, a tributary of the Little Missouri. A good range was selected, without encroachment upon the domains of the hunters already in the field, and the camp was made near the bank of the creek, close to a supply of wood and water, and screened from distant observation by a circle of hills and ridges. The two rectangular wall-tents were set up end to end, with the cook-stove in the middle, where the ends came together. In one tent the cooking and eating was done, and the other contained the beds. It was planned that the various members of the party should cook turn about, a week at a time, but one of them soon developed such a rare and conspicuous talent for bread-making and general cookery that he was elected by acclamation to cook during the entire season. To the other three members fell the hunting. Each man hunted separately from the others, and skinned all the animals that his rifle brought down. There were buffalo on the range when the hunters arrived, and the killing began at once. At daylight the still-hunter sallied forth on foot, carrying in his hand his huge Sharps rifle, weighing from 16 to 19 pounds, with from seventy-five to one hundred loaded cartridges in his two belts or his pockets. At his side, depending from his belt, hung his \"hunter\\'s companion,\" a flat leather scabbard, containing a ripping knife, a skinning knife, and a butcher\\'s steel upon which to sharpen them. The total weight carried was very considerable, seldom less than 36 pounds, and often more. Inasmuch as it was highly important to move camp as seldom as possible in the course of a season\\'s work, the hunter exercised the greatest precaution in killing his game, and had ever before his mind the necessity of doing his killing without frightening away the survivors. With ten thousand buffaloes on their range, it was considered the height of good luck to find a \"bunch\" of fifty head in a secluded \"draw\" or hollow, where it was possible to \"make a kill\" without disturbing the big herd. The still-hunter usually went on foot, for when buffaloes became so scarce as to make it necessary for him to ride his occupation was practically gone. At the time I speak of, the hunter seldom had to walk more than 3 miles from camp to find buffalo, in case there were any at all on his range, and it was usually an advantage to be without a horse. From the top of a ridge or high butte the country was carefully scanned, and if several small herds were in sight the one easiest to approach was selected as the one to attack. It was far better to find a herd lying down or quietly grazing, or sheltering from a cold wind, than to find it traveling, for while a hard run of a mile or two often enabled the hunter to \"head off\" a moving herd and kill a certain number of animals out of it, the net results were never half so satisfactory as with herds absolutely at rest. Having decided upon an attack, the hunter gets to leeward of his game, and approaches it according to the nature of the ground. If it is in a hollow, he secures a position at the top of the nearest ridge, as close as he can get. If it is in a level \"flat,\" he looks for a gully up which he can skulk until within good rifle-shot. If there is no gully, he may be obliged to crawl half a mile on his hands and knees, often through snow or amongst beds of prickly pear, taking advantage of even such scanty cover as sage-brush affords. Some Montana still-hunters adopted the method of drawing a gunny-sack over the entire upper half of the body, with holes cut for the eyes and arms, which simple but unpicturesque arrangement often enabled the hunter to approach his game much more easily and more closely than would otherwise have been possible. [Illustration: STILL-HUNTING BUFFALOES ON THE NORTHERN RANGE. From a painting by J. H. Moser, in the National Museum.] Having secured a position within from 100 to 250 yards of his game (often the distance was much greater), the hunter secures a comfortable rest for his huge rifle, all the time keeping his own person thoroughly hidden from view, estimates the distance, carefully adjusts his sights, and begins business. If the herd is moving, the animal in the lead is the first one shot, close behind the fore leg and about a foot above the brisket, which sends the ball through the lungs. If the herd is at rest, the oldest cow is always supposed to be the leader, and she is the one to kill first. The noise startles the buffaloes, they stare at the little cloud of white smoke and feel inclined to run, but seeing their leader hesitate they wait for her. She, when struck, gives a violent start forward, but soon stops, and the blood begins to run from her nostrils in two bright crimson streams. In a couple of minutes her body sways unsteadily, she staggers, tries hard to keep her feet, but soon gives a lurch sidewise and falls. Some of the other members of the herd come around her and stare and sniff in wide-eyed wonder, and one of the more wary starts to lead the herd away. But before she takes half a dozen steps \"bang!\" goes the hidden rifle again, and her leadership is ended forever. Her fall only increases the bewilderment of the survivors over a proceeding which to them is strange and unaccountable, because the danger is not visible. They cluster around the fallen ones, sniff at the warm blood, bawl aloud in wonderment, and do everything but run away. The policy of the hunter is to not fire too rapidly, but to attend closely to business, and every time a buffalo attempts to make off, shoot it down. One shot per minute was a moderate rate of firing, but under pressure of circumstances two per minute could be discharged with deliberate precision. With the most accurate hunting rifle ever made, a \"dead rest,\" and a large mark practically motionless, it was no wonder that nearly every shot meant a dead buffalo. The vital spot on a buffalo which stands with its side to the hunter is about a foot in diameter, and on a full-grown bull is considerably more. Under such conditions as the above, which was called getting \"a stand,\" the hunter nurses his victims just as an angler plays a big fish with light tackle, and in the most methodical manner murders them one by one, either until the last one falls, his cartridges are all expended, or the stupid brutes come to their senses and run away. Occasionally the poor fellow was troubled by having his rifle get too hot to use, but if a snow-bank was at hand he would thrust the weapon into it without ceremony to cool it off. A success in getting a stand meant the slaughter of a good-sized herd. A hunter whom I met in Montana, Mr. Harry Andrews, told me that he once fired one hundred and fifteen shots from one spot and killed sixty-three buffalo in less than an hour. The highest number Mr. McNaney ever knew of being killed in one stand was ninety-one head, but Colonel Dodge once counted one hundred and twelve carcasses of buffalo \"inside of a semicircle of 200 yards radius, all of which were killed by one man from the same spot, and in less than three-quarters of an hour.\" The \"kill\" being completed, the hunter then addressed himself to the task of skinning his victims. The northern hunters were seldom guilty of the reckless carelessness and lack of enterprise in the treatment of robes which at one time was so prominent a feature of work on the southern range. By the time white men began to hunt for robes on the northern range, buffalo were becoming comparatively scarce, and robes were worth from $2 to $4 each. The fur-buyers had taught the hunters, with the potent argument of hard cash, that a robe carefully and neatly taken off, stretched, and kept reasonably free from blood and dirt, was worth more money in the market than one taken off in a slovenly manner, and contrary to the nicer demands of the trade. After 1880, buffalo on the northern range were skinned with considerable care, and amongst the robe-hunters not one was allowed to become a loss when it was possible to prevent it. Every full-sized cow robe was considered equal to $3.50 in hard cash, and treated accordingly. The hunter, or skinner, always stretched every robe out on the ground to its fullest extent while it was yet warm, and cut the initials of his employer in the thin subcutaneous muscle which always adhered to the inside of the skin. A warm skin is very elastic, and when stretched upon the ground the hair holds it in shape until it either dries or freezes, and so retains its full size. On the northern range skins were so valuable that many a dispute arose between rival outfits over the ownership of a dead buffalo, some of which produced serious results. 2. _The chase on horseback or \"running buffalo.\"_--Next to the still-hunt the method called \"running buffalo\" was the most fatal to the race, and the one most universally practiced. To all hunters, save greedy white men, the chase on horseback yielded spoil sufficient for every need, and it also furnished sport of a superior kind--manly, exhilarating, and well spiced with danger. Even the horses shared the excitement and eagerness of their riders. So long as the weapons of the Indian consisted only of the bow and arrow and the spear, he was obliged to kill at close quarters or not at all. And even when fire-arms were first placed in his hands their caliber was so small, the charge so light, and the Indian himself so poor a marksman at long range, that his best course was still to gallop alongside the herd on his favorite \"buffalo horse\" and kill at the shortest possible range. From all accounts, the Red River half-breeds, who hunted almost exclusively with fire-arms, never dreamed of the deadly still hunt, but always killed their game by \"running\" it. In former times even the white men of the plains did the most of their buffalo hunting on horseback, using the largest-sized Colt\\'s revolver, sometimes one in each hand, until the repeating-rifle made its appearance, which in a great measure displaced the revolver in running buffalo. But about that time began the mad warfare for \"robes\" and \"hides,\" and the only fair and sportsmanlike method of hunting was declared too slow for the greedy buffalo-skinners. Then came the cold-blooded butchery of the still-hunt. From that time on the buffalo as a game animal steadily lost caste. It soon came to be universally considered that there was no sport in hunting buffalo. True enough of still-hunting, where the hunter sneaks up and shoots them down one by one at such long range the report of his big rifle does not even frighten them away. So far as sportsmanlike fairness is concerned, that method was not one whit more elevated than killing game by poison. Bat the chase on horseback was a different thing. Its successful prosecution demanded a good horse, a bold rider, a firm seat, and perfect familiarity with weapons. The excitement of it was intense, the dangers not to be despised, and, above all, the buffalo had a fair show for his life, or partially so, at least. The mode of attack is easily described. Whenever the hunters discovered a herd of buffalo, they usually got to leeward of it and quietly rode forward in a body, or stretched out in a regular skirmish line, behind the shelter of a knoll, perhaps, until they had approached the herd as closely as could be done without alarming it. Usually the unsuspecting animals, with a confidence due more to their great numbers than anything else, would allow a party of horsemen to approach within from 200 to 400 yards of their flankers, and then they would start off on a slow trot. The hunters then put spurs to their horses and dashed forward to overtake the herd as quickly as possible. Once up with it, each hunter chooses the best animal within his reach, chases him until his flying steed carries him close alongside, and then the arrow or the bullet is sent into his vitals. The fatal spot is from 12 to 18 inches in circumference, and lies immediately back of the fore leg, with its lowest point on a line with the elbow. This, the true chase of the buffalo, was not only exciting, but dangerous. It often happened that the hunter found himself surrounded by the flying herd, and in a cloud of dust, so that neither man nor horse could see the ground before them. Under such circumstances fatal accidents to both men and horses were numerous. It was not an uncommon thing for half-breeds to shoot each other in the excitement of the chase; and, while now and then a wounded bull suddenly turned upon his pursuer and overthrew him, the greatest number of casualties were from falls. Of the dangers involved in running buffalo Colonel Dodge writes as follows:[52] [Note 52: Plains of the Great West, p. 127.] \"The danger is not so much from the buffalo, which rarely makes an effort to injure his pursuer, as from the fact that neither man nor horse can see the ground, which may be rough and broken, or perforated with prairie-dog or gopher holes. This danger is so imminent, that a man who runs into a herd of buffalo may be said to take his life in his hand. I have never known a man hurt by a buffalo in such a chase. I have known of at least six killed, and a very great many more or less injured, some very severely, by their horses falling with them.\" On this point Catlin declares that to engage in running buffalo is \"at the hazard of every bone in one\\'s body, to feel the fine and thrilling exhilaration of the chase for a moment, and then as often to upbraid and blame himself for his folly and imprudence.\" Previous to my first experience in \"running buffalo\" I had entertained a mortal dread of ever being called upon to ride a chase across a prairie-dog town. The mouth of a prairie-dog\\'s burrow is amply large to receive the hoof of a horse, and the angle at which the hole descends into the earth makes it just right for the leg of a running horse to plunge into up to the knee and bring down both horse and rider instantly; the former with a broken leg, to say the least of it. If the rider sits loosely, and promptly resigns his seat, he will go flying forward, as if thrown from a catapult, for 20 feet or so, perhaps to escape with a few broken bones, and perhaps to have his neck broken, or his skull fractured on the hard earth. If he sticks tightly to his saddle, his horse is almost certain to fall upon him, and perhaps kill him. Judge, then, my feelings when the first bunch of buffalo we started headed straight across the largest prairie-dog town I had ever seen up to that time. And not only was the ground honey-combed with gaping round holes, but it was also crossed here and there by treacherous ditch-like gullies, cut straight down into the earth to an uncertain depth, and so narrow as to be invisible until it was almost time to leap across them. But at such a time, with the game thundering along a few rods in advance, the hunter thinks of little else except getting up to it. He looks as far ahead as possible, and helps his horse to avoid dangers, but to a great extent the horse must guide himself. The rider plies his spurs and looks eagerly forward, almost feverish with excitement and eagerness, but at the same time if he is wise he _expects_ a fall, and holds himself in readiness to take the ground with as little damage as he can. Mr. Catlin gives a most graphic description of a hunting accident, which may fairly be quoted in full as a type of many such. I must say that I fully sympathize with M. Chardon in his estimate of the hardness of the ground he fell upon, for I have a painful recollection of a fall I had from which I arose with the settled conviction that the ground in Montana is the hardest in the world! It seemed more like falling upon cast-iron than prairie turf. \"I dashed along through the thundering mass as they swept away over the plain, scarcely able to tell whether I was on a buffalo\\'s back or my horse, hit and hooked and jostled about, till at length I found myself alongside my game, when I gave him a shot as I passed him. [Illustration: THE CHASE ON HORSEBACK. From a painting in the National Museum by George Catlin.] I saw guns flash about me in several directions, but I heard them not. Amidst the trampling throng Mons. Chardon had wounded a stately bull, and at this moment was passing him with his piece leveled for another shot. They were both at full speed and I also, within the reach of the muzzle of my gun, when the bull instantly turned, receiving the horse upon his horns, and the ground received poor Chardon, who made a frog\\'s leap of some 20 feet or more over the bull\\'s back and almost under my horse\\'s heels. I wheeled my horse as soon as possible and rode back where lay poor Chardon, gasping to start his breath again, and within a few paces of him his huge victim, with his heels high in the air, and the horse lying across him. I dismounted instantly, but Chardon was raising himself on his hands, with his eyes and mouth full of dirt, and feeling for his gun, which lay about 30 feet in advance of him. \\'Heaven spare you! are you hurt, Chardon?\\' \\'Hi-hic--hic--hic--hic--no;--hic--no--no, I believe not. Oh, this is not much, Mons. Cataline--this is nothing new--but this is a d--d hard piece of ground here--hic--oh! hic!\\' At this the poor fellow fainted, but in a few moments arose, picked up his gun, took his horse by the bit, which then opened _its_ eyes, and with a _hic_ and a ugh--_ughk!_--sprang upon its feet, shook off the dirt, and here we were, all upon our legs again, save the bull, whose fate had been more sad than that of either.\"[53] [Note 53: North American Indians, I, pp. 25-26.] The following passage from Mr. Alexander Ross\\'s graphic description of a great hunt,[54] in which about four hundred hunters made an onslaught upon a herd, affords a good illustration of the dangers in running buffalo: [Note 54: Red River Settlement, p. 256.] \"On this occasion the surface was rocky and full of badger-holes. Twenty-three horses and riders were at one moment all sprawling on the ground; one horse, gored by a bull, was killed on the spot; two more were disabled by the fall; one rider broke his shoulder-blade; another burst his gun and lost three of his fingers by the accident; and a third was struck on the knee by an exhausted ball. These accidents will not be thought overnumerous, considering the result, for in the evening no less than thirteen hundred and seventy-five tongues were brought into camp.\" It really seems as if the horses of the plains entered willfully and knowingly into the war on the doomed herds. But for the willingness and even genuine eagerness with which the \"buffalo horses\" of both white men and Indians entered into the chase, hunting on horseback would have been attended with almost insurmountable difficulties, and the results would have been much less fatal to the species. According to all accounts the horses of the Indians and half-breeds were far better trained than those of their white rivals, no doubt owing to the fact that the use of the bow, which required the free use of both hands, was only possible when the horse took the right coarse of his own free will or else could be guided by the pressure of the knees. If we may believe the historians of that period, and there is not the slightest reason to doubt them, the \"buffalo horses\" of the Indians displayed almost as much intelligence and eagerness in the chase as did their human riders. Indeed, in \"running buffalo\" with only the bow and arrow, nothing but the willing co-operation of the horse could have possibly made this mode of hunting either satisfactory or successful. In Lewis and Clarke\\'s Travels, volume II, page 387, appears the following record: \"He [Sergeant Pryor] had found it almost impossible with two men to drive on the remaining horses, for as soon as they discovered a herd of buffaloes the loose horses immediately set off in pursuit of them, and surrounded the buffalo herd with almost as much skill as their riders could have done. At last he was obliged to send one horseman forward and drive all the buffaloes from the route.\" The Hon. H. H. Sibley, who once accompanied the Red River half-breeds on their annual hunt, relates the following[55]: \"One of the hunters fell from his saddle, and was unable to overtake his horse, which continued the chase as if he of himself could accomplish great things, so much do these animals become imbued with a passion for this sport! On another occasion a half-breed left his favorite steed at the camp, to enable him to recruit his strength, enjoining upon his wife the necessity of properly securing the animal, which was not done. Not relishing the idea of being left behind, he started after us and soon was alongside, and thus he continued to keep pace with the hunters in their pursuit of the buffalo, seeming to await with impatience the fall of some of them to the earth. The chase ended, he came neighing to his master, whom he soon singled out, although the men were dispersed here and there for a distance of miles.\" [Note 55: Schoolcraft\\'s \"North American Indians,\" 108.] Col. R. I. Dodge, in his Plains of the Great West, page 129, describes a meeting with two Mexican buffalo-hunters whose horses were so fleet and so well trained that whenever a herd of buffalo came in sight, instead of shooting their game wherever they came up with it, the one having the best horse would dash into the herd, cut out a fat two-year old, and, with the help of his partner, then actually drive it to their camp before shooting it down. \"They had a fine lot of meat and a goodly pile of skins, and they said that every buffalo had been driven into camp and killed as the one I saw. \\'It saves a heap of trouble packing the meat to camp,\\' said one of them, naively.\" Probably never before in the history of the world, until civilized man came in contact with the buffalo, did whole armies of men march out in true military style, with officers, flags, chaplains, and rules of war, and make war on wild animals. No wonder the buffalo has been exterminated. So long as they existed north of the Missouri in any considerable number, the half-breeds and Indians of the Manitoba Red River settlement used to gather each year in a great army, and go with carts to the buffalo range. On these great hunts, which took place every year from about the 15th of June to the 1st of September, vast numbers of buffalo were killed, and the supply was finally exhausted. As if Heaven had decreed the extirpation of the species, the half-breed hunters, like their white robe-hunting rivals farther south, always killed _cows_ in preference to bulls so long as a choice was possible, the very course best calculated to exterminate any species in the shortest possible time. The army of half-breeds and Indians which annually went forth from the Red River settlement to make war on the buffalo was often far larger than the army with which Cortez subdued a great empire. As early as 1846 it had become so great, that it was necessary to divide it into two divisions, one of which, the White Horse Plain division, was accustomed to go west by the Assinniboine River to the \"rapids crossing-place,\" and from there in a southwesterly direction. The Red River division went south to Pembina, and did the most of their hunting in Dakota. The two divisions sometimes met (says Professor Hind), but not intentionally. In 1849 a Mr. Flett took a census of the White Horse Plain division, in Dakota Territory, and found that it contained 603 carts, 700 half-breeds, 200 Indians, 600 horses, 200 oxen, 400 dogs, and 1 cat. In his \"Red River Settlement\" Mr. Alexander Ross gives the following census of the number of carts assembled in camp for the buffalo hunt at five different-periods: +--------------------------+ |_Number of carts assembled| | for the first trip._ | +--------------------------+ |In 1820 | 540| |In 1825 | 680| |In 1830 | 820| |In 1835 | 970| |In 1840 | 1,210| +--------------------------+ The expedition which was accompanied by Rev. Mr. Belcourt, a Catholic priest, whose account is set forth in the Hon. Mr. Sibley\\'s paper on the buffalo,[56] was a comparatively small one, which started from Pembina, and very generously took pains not to spoil the prospects of the great Red River division, which was expected to take the field at the same time. This, therefore, was a small party, like others which had already reached the range; but it contained 213 carts, 55 hunters and their families, making 60 lodges in all. This party killed 1,776 cows (bulls not counted, many of which were killed, though \"not even a tongue was taken\"), which yielded 228 bags of pemmican, 1,213 bales of dried meat, 166 sacks of tallow, and 556 bladders full of marrow. But this was very moderate slaughter, being about 33 buffalo to each family. Even as late as 1872, when buffalo were getting scarce, Mr. Grant[57] met a half-breed family on the Qu\\'Appelle, consisting of man, wife, and seven children, whose six carts were laden with the meat and robes yielded by _sixty_ buffaloes; that number representing this one hunter\\'s share of the spoils of the hunt. [Note 56: Schoolcraft, pp. 101-110.] [Note 57: Ocean to Ocean, p. 116.] To afford an idea of the truly military character of those Red River expeditions, I have only to quote a page from Prof. Henry Youle Hind:[58] [Note 58: Assinniboine and Saskatch. Exp. Exped., II, p. 111.] \"After the start from the settlement has been well made, and all stragglers or tardy hunters have arrived, a great council is held and a president elected. A number of captains are nominated by the president and people jointly. The captains then proceed to appoint their own policemen, the number assigned to each not exceeding ten. Their duties are to see that the laws of the hunt are strictly carried out. In 1840, if a man ran a buffalo without permission before the general hunt began, his saddle and bridle were cut to pieces for the first offense; for the second offense his clothes were cut off his back. At the present day these punishments are changed to a fine of 20 shillings for the first offense. No gun is permitted to be fired when in the buffalo country before the \\'race\\' begins. A priest sometimes goes with the hunt, and mass is then celebrated in the open prairies. \"At night the carts are placed in the form of a circle, with the horses and cattle inside the ring, and it is the duty of the captains and their policemen to see that this is rightly done. All laws are proclaimed in camp, and relate to the hunt alone. All camping orders are given by signal, a flag being carried by the guides, who are appointed by election. Each guide has his tarn of one day, and no man can pass a guide on duty without subjecting himself to a fine of 5 shillings. No hunter can leave the camp to return home without permission, and no one is permitted to stir until any animal or property of value supposed to be lost is recovered. The policemen, at the order of their captains, can seize any cart at night-fall and place it where they choose for the public safety, but on the following morning they are compelled to bring it back to the spot from which they moved it the previous evening. This power is very necessary, in order that the horses may not be stampeded by night attacks of the Sioux or other Indian tribes at war with the half-breeds. A heavy fine is imposed in case of neglect in extinguishing fires when the camp is broken up in the morning. \"In sight of buffalo all the hunters are drawn up in line, the president, captains, and police being a few yards in advance, restraining the impatient hunters. \\'Not yet! Not yet!\\' is the subdued whisper of the president. The approach to the herd is cautiously made. \\'Now!\\' the president exclaims; and as the word leaves his lips the charge is made, and in a few minutes the excited half-breeds are amongst the bewildered buffalo.\" \"After witnessing one buffalo hunt,\" says Prof. John Macoun, \"I can not blame the half-breed and the Indian for leaving the farm and wildly making for the plains when it is reported that buffalo have crossed the border.\" The \"great fall hunt\" was a regular event with about all the Indian tribes living within striking distance of the buffalo, in the course of which great numbers of buffalo were killed, great quantities of meat dried and made into pemmican, and all the skins taken were tanned in various ways to suit the many purposes they were called upon to serve. Mr. Francis La Flesche informs me that during the presence of the buffalo in western Nebraska and until they were driven south by the Sioux, the fall hunt of the Omahas was sometimes participated in by three hundred lodges, or about 3,000 people all told, six hundred of whom were warriors, and each of whom generally killed about ten buffaloes. The laws of the hunt were very strict and inexorable. In order that all participants should have an equal chance, it was decreed that any hunter caught \"still-hunting\" should be soundly flogged. On one occasion an Indian was discovered in the act, but not caught. During the chase which was made to capture him many arrows were fired at him by the police, but being better mounted than his pursuers he escaped, and kept clear of the camp during the remainder of the hunt. On another occasion an Omaha, guilty of the same offense, was chased, and in his effort to escape his horse fell with him in a coulée and broke one of his legs. In spite of the sad plight of the Omaha, his pursuers came up and flogged him, just as if nothing had happened. After the invention of the Colt\\'s revolver, and breech-loading rifles generally, the chase on horseback speedily became more fatal to the bison than it ever had been before. With such weapons, it was possible to gallop into the midst of a flying herd and, during the course of a run of 2 or 3 miles, discharge from twelve to forty shots at a range of only a few yards, or even a few feet. In this kind of hunting the heavy Navy revolver was the favorite weapon, because it could be held in one hand and fired with far greater precision than could a rifle held in both hands. Except in the hands of an expert, the use of the rifle was limited, and often attended with risk to the hunter; but the revolver was good for all directions; it could very often be used with deadly effect where a rifle could not have been used at all, and, moreover, it left the bridle-hand free. Many cavalrymen and hunters were able to use a revolver with either hand, or one in each hand. Gen. Lew. Wallace preferred the Smith and Wesson in 1867, which he declared to be \"the best of revolvers\" then. It was his marvelous skill in shooting buffaloes with a rifle, from the back of a galloping horse, that earned for the Hon. W. F. Cody the sobriquet by which he is now familiarly known to the world--\"Buffalo Bill.\" To the average hunter on horseback the galloping of the horse makes it easy for him to aim at the heart of a buffalo and shoot clear over its back. No other shooting is so difficult, or requires such consummate dexterity as shooting with any kind of a gun, especially a rifle, from the back of a running horse. Let him who doubts this statement try it for himself and he will doubt no more. It was in the chase of the buffalo on horseback, armed with a rifle, that \"Buffalo Bill\" acquired the marvelous dexterity with the rifle which he has since exhibited in the presence of the people of two continents. I regret that circumstances have prevented my obtaining the exact figures of the great kill of buffaloes that Mr. Cody once made in a single run, in which he broke all previous records in that line, and fairly earned his title. In 1867 he entered into a contract with the Kansas Pacific Railway, then in course of construction through western Kansas, at a monthly salary of $500, to deliver all the buffalo meat that would be required by the army of laborers engaged in building the road. In eighteen mouths he killed 4,280 buffaloes. 3. _Impounding or Killing in Pens._--At first thought it seems hard to believe that it was ever possible for Indians to build pens and drive wild buffaloes into them, as cowboys now corral their cattle, yet such wholesale catches were of common occurrence among the Plains Crees of the south Saskatchewan country, and the same general plan was pursued, with slight modifications, by the Indians of the Assinniboine, Blackfeet, and Gros Ventres, and other tribes of the Northwest. Like the keddah elephant-catching operations in India, this plan was feasible only in a partially wooded country, and where buffalo were so numerous that their presence could be counted upon to a certainty. The \"pound\" was simply a circular pen, having a single entrance; but being unable to construct a gate of heavy timbers, such as is made to drop and close the entrance to an elephant pen, the Indians very shrewdly got over the difficulty by making the opening at the edge of a perpendicular bank 10 or 12 feet high, easy enough for a buffalo to jump down, but impossible for him to scale afterward. It is hardly probable that Indians who were expert enough to attack and kill buffalo on foot would have been tempted to undertake the labor that building a pound always involved, had it not been for the wild excitement attending captures made in this way, and which were shared to the fullest possible extent by warriors, women, and children alike. The best description of this method which has come under our notice is that of Professor Hind, who witnessed its practice by the Plains Crees, on the headwaters of the Qu\\'Appelle River, in 1858. He describes the pound he saw as a fence, constructed of the trunks of trees laced together with green withes, and braced on the outside by props, inclosing a circular space about 120 feet in diameter. It was placed in a pretty dell between sand-hills, and leading from it in two diverging rows (like the guiding wings of an elephant pen) were the two rows of bushes which the Indians designate \"dead men,\" which serve to guide the buffalo into the pound. The \"dead men\" extended a distance of 4 miles into the prairie. They were placed about 50 feet apart, and the two rows gradually diverged until at their extremities they were from 11/2 to 2 miles apart. [Illustration: CREE INDIANS IMPOUNDING BUFFALOES. Reproduced from Prof. H. Y. Hind\\'s--\"Red River, Assinniboine and Saskatchewan Expedition.\"] \"When the skilled hunters are about to bring in a herd of buffalo from the prairie,\" says Professor Hind, \"they direct the course of the gallop of the alarmed animals by confederates stationed in hollows or small depressions, who, when the buffalo appear inclined to take a direction leading from the space marked out by the \\'dead men,\\' show themselves for a moment and wave their robes, immediately hiding again. This serves to turn the buffalo slightly in another direction, and when the animals, having arrived between the rows of \\'dead men,\\' endeavor to pass through them, Indians stationed here and there behind a \\'dead man\\' go through the same operation, and thus keep the animals within the narrowing limits of the converging lines. At the entrance to the pound there is a strong trunk of a tree placed about a foot from the ground, and on the inner side an excavation is made sufficiently deep to prevent the buffalo from leaping back when once in the pound. As soon as the animals have taken the fatal spring, they begin to gallop round and round the ring fence, looking for a chance to escape, but with the utmost silence women and children on the outside hold their robes before every orifice until the whole herd is brought in; then they climb to the top of the fence, and, with the hunters who have followed closely in the rear of the buffalo, spear or shoot with bows and arrows or fire-arms at the bewildered animals, rapidly becoming frantic with rage and terror, within the narrow limits of the pound. \"A dreadful scene of confusion and slaughter then begins; the oldest and strongest animals crush and toss the weaker; the shouts and screams of the excited Indians rise above the roaring of the bulls, the bellowing of the cows, and the piteous moaning of the calves. The dying struggles of so many huge and powerful animals crowded together create a revolting and terrible scene, dreadful from the excess of its cruelty and waste of life, but with occasional displays of wonderful brute strength and rage; while man in his savage, untutored, and heathen state shows both in deed and expression how little he is superior to the noble beasts he so wantonly and cruelly destroys.\"[59] [Note 59: Assinniboine and Saskatchewan Expedition, p. 358.] The last scene of the bloody tragedy is thus set forth a week later: \"Within the circular fence ... lay, tossed in every conceivable position, over two hundred dead buffalo. [The exact number was 240.] From old bulls to calves of three months\\' old, animals of every age were huddled together in all the forced attitudes of violent death. Some lay on their backs, with eyes starting from their heads and tongue thrust out through clotted gore. Others were impaled on the horns of the old and strong bulls. Others again, which had been tossed, were lying with broken backs, two and three deep. One little calf hung suspended on the horns of a bull which had impaled it in the wild race round and round the pound. The Indians looked upon the dreadful and sickening sight with evident delight, and told how such and such a bull or cow had exhibited feats of wonderful strength in the death-struggle. The flesh of many of the cows had been taken from them, and was drying in the sun on stages near the tents. It is needless to say that the odor was overpowering, and millions of large blue flesh-flies, humming and buzzing over the putrefying bodies, was not the least disgusting part of the spectacle.\" It is some satisfaction to know that when the first \"run\" was made, ten days previous, the herd of two hundred buffaloes was no sooner driven into the pound than a wary old bull espied a weak spot in the fence, charged it at full speed, and burst through to freedom and the prairie, followed by the entire herd. Strange as it may seem to-day, this wholesale method of destroying buffalo was once practiced in Montana. In his memoir on \"The American Bison,\" Mr. J. A. Allen states that as late as 1873, while journeying through that Territory in charge of the Yellowstone Expedition, he \"several times met with the remains of these pounds and their converging fences in the region above the mouth of the Big Horn River.\" Mr. Thomas Simpson states that in 1840 there were three camps of Assinniboine Indians in the vicinity of Carlton House, each of which had its buffalo pound into which they drove forty or fifty animals daily. 4. _The \"Surround.\"_--During the last forty years the final extermination of the buffalo has been confidently predicted by not only the observing white man of the West, but also nearly all the Indians and half-breeds who formerly depended upon this animal for the most of the necessities, as well as luxuries, of life. They have seen the great herds driven westward farther and farther, until the plains were left tenantless, and hunger took the place of feasting on the choice tid-bits of the chase. And is it not singular that during this period the Indian tribes were not moved by a common impulse to kill sparingly, and by the exercise of a reasonable economy in the chase to make the buffalo last as long as possible. But apparently no such thoughts ever entered their minds, so far as _they themselves_ were concerned. They looked with jealous eyes upon the white hunter, and considered him as much of a robber as if they had a brand on every buffalo. It has been claimed by some authors that the Indians killed with more judgment and more care for the future than did the white man, but I fail to find any evidence that such was ever the fact. They all killed wastefully, wantonly, and always about five times as many head as were really necessary for food. It was always the same old story, whenever a gang of Indians needed meat a whole herd was slaughtered, the choicest portions of the finest animals were taken, and about 75 per cent of the whole left to putrefy and fatten the wolves. And now, as we read of the appalling slaughter, one can scarcely repress the feeling of grim satisfaction that arises when we also read that many of the ex-slaughterers are almost starving for the millions of pounds of fat and juicy buffalo meat they wasted a few years ago. Verily, the buffalo is in a great measure avenged already. The following extract from Mr. Catlin\\'s \"North American Indians,\"[60] I, page 199-200, serves well to illustrate not only a very common and very deadly Indian method of wholesale slaughter--the \"surround\"--but also to show the senseless destructiveness of Indians even when in a state of semi-starvation, which was brought upon them by similar acts of improvidence and wastefulness. [Note 60: H. Mis. 600, pt. 2-31] \"The Minatarees, as well as the Mandans, had suffered for some months past for want of meat, and had indulged in the most alarming fears that the herds of buffalo were emigrating so far off from them that there was great danger of their actual starvation, when it was suddenly announced through the village one morning at an early hour that a herd of buffaloes was in sight. A hundred or more young men mounted their horses, with weapons in hand, and steered their course to the prairies. * * * \"The plan of attack, which in this country is familiarly called a surround, was explicitly agreed upon, and the hunters, who were all mounted on their \\'buffalo horses\\' and armed with bows and arrows or long lances, divided into two columns, taking opposite directions, and drew themselves gradually around the herd at a mile or more distance from them, thus forming a circle of horsemen at equal distances apart, who gradually closed in upon them with a moderate pace at a signal given. The unsuspecting herd at length \\'got the wind\\' of the approaching enemy and fled in a mass in the greatest confusion. To the point where they were aiming to cross the line the horsemen were seen, at full speed, gathering and forming in a column, brandishing their weapons, and yelling in the most frightful manner, by which they turned the black and rushing mass, which moved off in an opposite direction, where they were again met and foiled in a similar manner, and wheeled back in utter confusion; by which time the horsemen had closed in from all directions, forming a continuous line around them, whilst the poor affrighted animals were eddying about in a crowded and confused mass, hooking and climbing upon each other, when the work of death commenced. I had rode up in the rear and occupied an elevated position at a few rods\\' distance, from which I could (like the general of a battlefield) survey from my horse\\'s back the nature and the progress of the grand _mêlée_, but (unlike him) without the power of issuing a command or in any way directing its issue. \"In this grand turmoil [see illustration] a cloud of dust was soon raised, which in parts obscured the throng where the hunters were galloping their horses around and driving the whizzing arrows or their long lances to the hearts of these noble animals; which in many instances, becoming infuriated with deadly wounds in their sides, erected their shaggy manes over their bloodshot eyes and furiously plunged forward at the sides of their assailants\\' horses, sometimes goring them to death at a lunge and putting their dismounted riders to flight for their lives. Sometimes their dense crowd was opened, and the blinded horsemen, too intent on their prey amidst the cloud of dust, were hemmed and wedged in amidst the crowding beasts, over whose backs they were obliged to leap for security, leaving their horses to the fate that might await them in the results of this wild and desperate war. Many were the bulls that turned upon their assailants and met them with desperate resistance, and many were the warriors who were dismounted and saved themselves by the superior muscles of their legs; some who were closely pursued by the bulls wheeled suddenly around, and snatching the part of a buffalo robe from around their waists, threw it over the horns and eyes of the infuriated beast, and darting by its side drove the arrow or the lance to its heart; others suddenly dashed off upon the prairie by the side of the affrighted animals which had escaped from the throng, and closely escorting them for a few rods, brought down their heart\\'s blood in streams and their huge carcasses upon the green and enameled turf. \"In this way this grand hunt soon resolved itself into a desperate battle, _and in the space of fifteen minutes resulted in the total destruction of the whole herd_, which in all their strength and fury were doomed, like every beast and living thing else, to fall before the destroying hands of mighty man. \"I had sat in trembling silence upon my horse and witnessed this extraordinary scene, which allowed not one of these animals to escape out of my sight. Many plunged off upon the prairie for a distance, but were overtaken and killed, and although I could not distinctly estimate the number that were slain, yet I am sure that some hundreds of these noble animals fell in this grand _mêlée_. * * * Amongst the poor affrighted creatures that had occasionally dashed through the ranks of their enemy and sought safety in flight upon the prairie (and in some instances had undoubtedly gained it), I saw them stand awhile, looking back, when they turned, and, as if bent on their own destruction, retraced their steps, and mingled themselves and their deaths with those of the dying throng. Others had fled to a distance on the prairies, and for want of company, of friends or of foes, had stood and gazed on till the battle-scene was over, seemingly taking pains to stay and hold their lives in readiness for their destroyers until the general destruction was over, when they fell easy victims to their weapons, making the slaughter complete.\" It is to be noticed that _every animal_ of this entire herd of several hundred was slain on the spot, and there is no room to doubt that at least half (possibly much more) of the meat thus taken was allowed to become a loss. People who are so utterly senseless as to wantonly destroy their own source of food, as the Indians have done, certainly deserve to starve. This \"surround\" method of wholesale slaughter was also practiced by the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Sioux, Pawnees, Ornabas, and probably many other tribes. [Illustration: THE SURROUND. From a painting in the National Museum by George Catlin.] 5. _Decoying and Driving._--Another method of slaughtering by wholesale is thus described by Lewis and Clarke, I, 235. The locality indicated was the Missouri River, in Montana, just above the mouth of Judith River: \"On the north we passed a precipice about 120 feet high, under which lay scattered the fragments of at least one hundred carcasses of buffaloes, although the water which had washed away the lower part of the hill, must have carried off many of the dead. These buffaloes had been chased down a precipice in a way very common on the Missouri, and by which vast herds are destroyed in a moment. The mode of hunting is to select one of the most active and fleet young men, who is disguised by a buffalo skin round his body; the skin of the head with the ears and horns fastened on his own head in such a way as to deceive the buffaloes. Thus dressed, he fixes himself at a convenient distance between a herd of buffaloes and any of the river precipices, which sometimes extend for some miles. \"His companions in the mean time get in the rear and side of the herd, and at a given signal show themselves, and advance towards the buffaloes. They instantly take alarm, and, finding the hunters beside them, they run toward the disguised Indian or decoy, who leads them on at full speed toward the river, when, suddenly securing himself in some crevice of the cliff which he had previously fixed on, the herd is left on the brink of the precipice; it is then in vain for the foremost to retreat or even to stop; they are pressed on by the hindmost rank, who, seeing no danger but from the hunters, goad on those before them till the whole are precipitated and the shore is strewed with their dead bodies. Sometimes in this perilous seduction the Indian is himself either trodden under foot by the rapid movements of the buffaloes, or, missing his footing in the cliff, is urged down the precipice by the falling herd. The Indians then select as much meat as they wish, and the rest is abandoned to the wolves, and creates a most dreadful stench.\" Harper\\'s Magazine, volume 38, page 147, contains the following from the pen of Theo. E. Davis, in an article entitled \"The Buffalo Range:\" \"As I have previously stated, the best hunting on the range is to be found between the Platte and Arkansas Rivers. Here I have seen the Indians have recourse to another method of slaughtering buffalo in a very easy, but to me a cruel way, for where one buffalo is killed several are sure to be painfully injured; but these, too, are soon killed by the Indians, who make haste to lance or shoot the cripples. \"The mode of hunting is somewhat as follows: A herd is discovered grazing on the table-lands. Being thoroughly acquainted with the country, the Indians are aware of the location of the nearest point where the table land is broken abruptly by a precipice which descends a hundred or more feet. Toward this \\'devil-jump\\' the Indians head the herd, which is at once driven pell mell to and over the precipice. Meanwhile a number of Indians have taken their way by means of routes known to them, and succeed in reaching the cañon through which the crippled buffalo are running in all directions. These are quickly killed, so that out of a very considerable band of buffalo but few escape, many having been killed by the fall and others dispatched while limping off. This mode of hunting is sometimes indulged in by harum-scarum white men, but it is done more for deviltry than anything else. I have never known of its practice by army officers or persons who professed to hunt buffalo as a sport.\" 6. _Hunting on Snow-shoes._--\"In the dead of the winters,\" says Mr. Catlin,[61] \"which are very long and severely cold in this country, where horses can not be brought into the chase with any avail, the Indian runs upon the surface of the snow by aid of his snow-shoes, which buoy him up, while the great weight of the buffaloes sinks them down to the middle of their sides, and, completely stopping their progress, insures them certain and easy victims to the bow or lance of their pursuers. The snow in these regions often lies during the winter to the depth of 3 and 4 feet, being blown away from the tops and sides of the hills in many places, which are left bare for the buffaloes to graze upon, whilst it is drifted in the hollows and ravines to a very great depth, and rendered almost entirely impassable to these huge animals, which, when closely pursued by their enemies, endeavor to plunge through it, but are soon wedged in and almost unable to move, where they fall an easy prey to the Indian, who runs up lightly upon his snow-shoes and drives his lance to their hearts. The skins are then stripped off, to be sold to the fur traders, and the carcasses left to be devoured by the wolves. [Owing to the fact that the winter\\'s supply of meat was procured and dried in the summer and fall months, the flesh of all buffalo killed in winter was allowed to become a total loss.] This is the season in which the greatest number of these animals are destroyed for their robes; they are most easily killed at this time, and their hair or fur, being longer and more abundant, gives greater value to the robe.\" [Note 61: North American Indians, I, 253.] * * * * * III. PROGRESS OF THE EXTERMINATION. A. THE PERIOD OF DESULTORY DESTRUCTION, FROM 1730 TO 1830. [Illustration: INDIANS ON SNOW-SHOES HUNTING BUFFALOES. From a painting in the National Museum by George Catlin.] The disappearance of the buffalo from all the country east of the Mississippi was one of the inevitable results of the advance of civilization. To the early pioneers who went forth into the wilderness to wrestle with nature for the necessities of life, this valuable animal might well have seemed a gift direct from the hand of Providence. During the first few years of the early settler\\'s life in a new country, the few domestic animals he had brought with him were far too valuable to be killed for food, and for a long period he looked to the wild animals of the forest and the prairie for his daily supply of meat. The time was when no one stopped to think of the important part our game animals played in the settlement of this country, and even now no one has attempted to calculate the lessened degree of rapidity with which the star of empire would have taken its westward way without the bison, deer, elk, and antelope. The Western States and Territories pay little heed to the wanton slaughter of deer and elk now going on in their forests, but the time will soon come when the \"grangers\" will enter those regions and find the absence of game a very serious matter. Although the bison was the first wild species to disappear before the advance of civilization, he served a good purpose at a highly critical period. His huge bulk of toothsome flesh fed many a hungry family, and his ample robe did good service in the settler\\'s cabin and sleigh in winter weather. By the time game animals had become scarce, domestic herds and flocks had taken their place, and hunting became a pastime instead of a necessity. As might be expected, from the time the bison was first seen by white men he has always been a conspicuous prize, and being the largest of the land quadrupeds, was naturally the first to disappear. Every man\\'s hand has been against him. While his disappearance from the eastern United States was, in the main, due to the settler who killed game as a means of subsistence, there were a few who made the killing of those animals a regular business. This occurred almost exclusively in the immediate vicinity of salt springs, around which the bison congregated in great numbers, and made their wholesale slaughter of easy accomplishment. Mr. Thomas Ashe[62] has recorded some very interesting facts and observations on this point. In speaking of an old man who in the latter part of the last century built a log house for himself \"on the immediate borders of a salt spring,\" in western Pennsylvania, for the purpose of killing buffaloes out of the immense droves which frequented that spot, Mr. Ashe says: [Note 62: Travels in America in 1806. London, 1808.] \"In the first and second years this old man, with some companions, killed from six to seven hundred of these noble creatures merely for the sake of their skins, which to them were worth only 2 shillings each; and after this \\'work of death\\' they were obliged to leave the place till the following season, or till the wolves, bears, panthers, eagles, rooks, ravens, etc., had devoured the carcasses and abandoned the place for other prey. In the two following years the same persons killed great numbers out of the first droves that arrived, skinned them, and left their bodies exposed to the sun and air; but they soon had reason to repent of this, for the remaining droves, as they came up in succession, stopped, gazed on the mangled and putrid bodies, sorrowfully moaned or furiously lowed aloud, and returned instantly to the wilderness in an unusual run, without tasting their favorite spring or licking the impregnated earth, which was also once their most agreeable occupation; nor did they nor any of their race ever revisit the neighborhood. \"The simple history of this spring is that of every other in the settled parts of this Western World; the carnage of beasts was everywhere the same. I met with a man who had killed two thousand buffaloes with his own hand, and others no doubt have done the same thing. In consequence of such proceedings not one buffalo is at this time to be found east of the Mississippi, except a few domesticated by the curious, or carried through the country on a public show.\" But, fortunately, there is no evidence that such slaughter as that described by Mr. Ashe was at all common, and there is reason for the belief that until within the last forty years the buffalo was sacrificed in ways conducive to the greatest good of the greatest number. From Coronado to General Frémont there has hardly been an explorer of United States territory who has not had occasion to bless the bison, and its great value to mankind can hardly be overestimated, although by many it can readily be forgotten. The disappearance of the bison from the eastern United States was due to its consumption as food. It was very gradual, like the march of civilization, and, under the circumstances, absolutely inevitable. In a country so thickly peopled as this region speedily became, the mastodon could have survived extinction about as easily as the bison. Except when the latter became the victim of wholesale slaughter, there was little reason to bemoan his fate, save upon grounds that may be regarded purely sentimental. He served a most excellent purpose in the development of the country. Even as late as 1875 the farmers of eastern Kansas were in the habit of making trips every fall into the western part of that State for wagon loads of buffalo meat as a supply for the succeeding winter. The farmers of Texas, Nebraska, Dakota, and Minnesota also drew largely upon the buffalo as long as the supply lasted. The extirpation of the bison west of the Rocky Mountains was due to legitimate hunting for food and clothing rather than for marketable peltries. In no part of that whole region was the species ever numerous, although in the mountains themselves, notably in Colorado, within easy reach of the great prairies on the east, vast numbers were seen by the early explorers and pioneers. But to the westward, away from the mountains, they were very rarely met with, and their total destruction in that region was a matter of easy accomplishment. According to Prof. J. A. Allen the complete disappearance of the bison west of the Rocky Mountains took place between 1838 and 1840. B. THE PERIOD OF SYSTEMATIC SLAUGHTER, FROM 1830 TO 1838. We come now to a history which I would gladly leave unwritten. Its record is a disgrace to the American people in general, and the Territorial, State, and General Government in particular. It will cause succeeding generations to regard us as being possessed of the leading characteristics of the savage and the beast of prey--cruelty and greed. We will be likened to the blood-thirsty tiger of the Indian jungle, who slaughters a dozen bullocks at once when he knows he can eat only one. In one respect, at least, the white men who engaged in the systematic slaughter of the bison were savages just as much as the Piegan Indians, who would drive a whole herd over a precipice to secure a week\\'s rations of meat for a single village. The men who killed buffaloes for their tongues and those who shot them from the railway trains for sport were murderers. In no way does civilized man so quickly revert to his former state as when he is alone with the beasts of the field. Give him a gun and something which he may kill without getting himself in trouble, and, presto! he is instantly a savage again, finding exquisite delight in bloodshed, slaughter, and death, if not for gain, then solely for the joy and happiness of it. There is no kind of warfare against game animals too unfair, too disreputable, or too mean for white men to engage in if they can only do so with safety to their own precious carcasses. They will shoot buffalo and antelope from running railway trains, drive deer into water with hounds and cut their throats in cold blood, kill does with fawns a week old, kill fawns by the score for their spotted skins, slaughter deer, moose, and caribou in the snow at a pitiful disadvantage, just as the wolves do; exterminate the wild ducks on the whole Atlantic seaboard with punt guns for the metropolitan markets; kill off the Rocky Mountain goats for hides worth only 50 cents apiece, destroy wagon loads of trout with dynamite, and so on to the end of the chapter. Perhaps the most gigantic task ever undertaken on this continent in the line of game-slaughter was the extermination of the bison in the great pasture region by the hide-hunters. Probably the brilliant rapidity and success with which that lofty undertaking was accomplished was a matter of surprise even to those who participated in it. The story of the slaughter is by no means a long one. The period of systematic slaughter of the bison naturally begins with the first organized efforts in that direction, in a business-like, wholesale way. Although the species had been steadily driven westward for a hundred years by the advancing settlements, and had during all that time been hunted for the meat and robes it yielded, its extermination did not begin in earnest until 1820, or thereabouts. As before stated, various persons had previous to that time made buffalo killing a business in order to sell their skins, but such instances were very exceptional. By that time the bison was totally extinct in all the region lying east of the Mississippi River except a portion of Wisconsin, where it survived until about 1830. In 1820 the first organized buffalo hunting expedition on a grand scale was made from the Red River settlement, Manitoba, in which five hundred and forty carts proceeded to the range. Previous to that time the buffaloes were found near enough to the settlements around Fort Garry that every settler could hunt independently; but as the herds were driven farther and farther away, it required an organized effort and a long journey to reach them. The American Fur Company established trading posts along the Missouri River, one at the mouth of the Tetón River and another at the mouth of the Yellowstone. In 1826 a post was established at the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, at the head of the Arkansas River, and in 1832 another was located in a corresponding situation at the head of the South Fork of the Platte, close to where Denver now stands. Both the latter were on what was then the western border of the buffalo range. Elsewhere throughout the buffalo country there were numerous other posts, always situated as near as possible to the best hunting ground, and at the same time where they would be most accessible to the hunters, both white and red. As might be supposed, the Indians were encouraged to kill buffaloes for their robes, and this is what Mr. George Catlin wrote at the mouth of the Tetón River (Pyatt County, Dakota) in 1832 concerning this trade:[63] \"It seems hard and cruel (does it not?) that we civilized people, with all the luxuries and comforts of the world about us, should be drawing from the backs of these useful animals the skins for our luxury, leaving their carcasses to be devoured by the wolves; that we should draw from that country some one hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand of their robes annually, the greater part of which are taken from animals that are killed expressly for the robe, at a season when the meat is not cured and preserved, and for each of which skins the Indian has received but a pint of whisky! Such is the fact, and that number, or near it, are annually destroyed, in addition to the number that is necessarily killed for the subsistence of three hundred thousand Indians, who live chiefly upon them.\" The author further declared that the fur trade in those \"great western realms\" was then limited chiefly to the purchase of buffalo robes. 1. _The Red River half-breeds._--In June, 1840, when the Red River half-breeds assembled at Pembina for their annual expedition against the buffalo, they mustered as follows: +-------------------------------------+ |Carts |1,210| +-------------------------+-----+-----+ |Hunters | 620| | +-------------------------+-----+ | |Women | 650|1,630| +-------------------------+-----+ | |Boys and girls | 360| | +-------------------------+-----+-----+ |Horses (buffalo runners) | 403| +-------------------------------+-----+ |Dogs | 542| +-------------------------------+-----+ |Cart horses | 655| +-------------------------------+-----+ |Draught oxen | 586| +-------------------------------+-----+ |Skinning knives |1,240| +-------------------------------------+ The total value of the property employed in this expedition and the working time occupied by it (two months) amounted to the enormous sum of £24,000. [Note 63: North American Indians, I, p. 263.] Although the bison formerly ranged to Fort Garry (near Winnipeg), they had been steadily killed off and driven back, and in 1840 none were found by the expedition until it was 250 miles from Pembina, which is situated on the Red River, at the international boundary. At that time the extinction of the species from the Red River to the Cheyenne was practically complete. The Red River settlers, aided, of course, by the Indians of that region, are responsible for the extermination of the bison throughout northeastern Dakota as far as the Cheyenne River, northern Minnesota, and the whole of what is now the province of Manitoba. More than that; as the game grew scarce and retired farther and farther, the half-breeds, who despised agriculture as long as there was a buffalo to kill, extended their hunting operations westward along the Qu\\'Appelle until they encroached upon the hunting-grounds of the Plain Crees, who lived in the Saskatchewan country. Thus was an immense inroad made in the northern half of the herd which had previously covered the entire pasture region from the Great Slave Lake to central Texas. This was the first visible impression of the systematic killing which began in 1820. Up to 1840 it is reasonably certain, as will be seen by figures given elsewhere, that by this business-like method of the half-breeds, at least 652,000 buffaloes were destroyed by them alone. Even as early as 1840 the Red River hunt was prosecuted through Dakota southwestwardly to the Missouri River and a short distance beyond it. Here it touched the wide strip of territory, bordering that stream, which was even then being regularly drained of its animal resources by the Indian hunters, who made the river their base of operations, and whose robes were shipped on its steam-boats. It is certain that these annual Red River expeditions into Dakota were kept up as late as 1847, and as long thereafter as buffaloes were to be found in any number between the Cheyenne and the Missouri. At the same time, the White Horse Plains division, which hunted westward from Fort Garry, did its work of destruction quite as rapidly and as thoroughly as the rival expedition to the United States. In 1857 the Plains Crees, inhabiting the country around the headwaters of the Qu\\'Appelle River (250 miles due west from Winnipeg), assembled in council, and \"determined that in consequence of promises often made and broken by the white men and half-breeds, and the rapid destruction by them of the buffalo they fed on, they would not permit either white men or half-breeds to hunt in their country, or travel through it, except for the purpose of trading for their dried meat, pemmican, skins and robes.\" In 1858 the Crees reported that between the two branches of the Saskatchewan buffalo were \"very scarce.\" Professor Hind\\'s expedition saw only one buffalo in the whole course of their journey from Winnipeg until they reached Sand Hill Lake, at the head of the Qu\\'Appelle, near the south branch of the Saskatchewan, where the first herd was encountered. Although the species was not totally extinct on the Qu\\'Appelle at that time, it was practically so. 2. _The country of the Sioux._--The next territory completely depopulated of buffaloes by systematic hunting was very nearly the entire southern half of Dakota, southwestern Minnesota, and northern Nebraska as far as the North Platte. This vast region, once the favorite range for hundreds of thousands of buffaloes, had for many years been the favorite hunting ground of the Sioux Indians of the Missouri, the Pawnees, Omahas, and all other tribes of that region. The settlement of Iowa and Minnesota presently forced into this region the entire body of Mississippi Sioux from the country west of Prairie du Chien and around Fort Snelling, and materially hastened the extermination of all the game animals which were once so abundant there. It is absolutely certain that if the Indians had been uninfluenced by the white traders, or, in other words, had not been induced to take and prepare a large number of robes every year for the market, the species would have survived very much longer than it did. But the demand quickly proved to be far greater than the supply. The Indians, of course, found it necessary to slaughter annually a great number of buffaloes for their own wants--for meat, robes, leather, teepees, etc. When it came to supplementing this necessary slaughter by an additional fifty thousand or more every year for marketable robes, it is no wonder that the improvident savages soon found, when too late, that the supply of buffaloes was not inexhaustible. Naturally enough, they attributed their disappearance to the white man, who was therefore a robber, and a proper subject for the scalping-knife. Apparently it never occurred to the minds of the Sioux that they themselves were equally to blame; it was always _the paleface_ who killed the buffaloes; and it was always _Sioux_ buffaloes that they killed. The Sioux seemed to feel that they held a chattel mortgage on all the buffaloes north of the Platte, and it required more than one pitched battle to convince them otherwise. Up to the time when the great Sioux Reservation was established in Dakota (1875-\\'77), when 33,739 square miles of country, or nearly the whole southwest quarter of the Territory, was set aside for the exclusive occupancy of the Sioux, buffaloes were very numerous throughout that entire region. East of the Missouri River, which is the eastern boundary of the Sioux Reservation, from Bismarck all the way down, the species was practically extinct as early as 1870. But at the time when it became unlawful for white hunters to enter the territory of the Sioux nation there were tens of thousands of buffaloes upon it, and their subsequent slaughter is chargeable to the Indians alone, save as to those which migrated into the hunting grounds of the whites. 3. _Western railways, and their part in the extermination of the buffalo._--The building of a railroad means the speedy extermination of all the big game along its line. In its eagerness to attract the public and build up \"a big business,\" every new line which traverses a country containing game does its utmost, by means of advertisements and posters, to attract the man with a gun. Its game resorts are all laid bare, and the market hunters and sportsmen swarm in immediately, slaying and to slay. Within the last year the last real retreat for our finest game, the only remaining stronghold for the mountain sheep, goat, caribou, elk, and deer--northwestern Montana, northern Idaho, and thence westward--has been laid open to the very heart by the building of the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway, which runs up the valley of the Milk River to Fort Assinniboine, and crosses the Rocky Mountains through Two Medicine Pass. Heretofore that region has been so difficult to reach that the game it contains has been measurably secure from general slaughter; but now it also must \"go.\" The marking out of the great overland trail by the Argonauts of \\'49 in their rush for the gold fields of California was the foreshadowing of the great east-and-west breach in the universal herd, which was made twenty years later by the first transcontinental railway. The pioneers who \"crossed the plains\" in those days killed buffaloes for food whenever they could, and the constant harrying of those animals experienced along the line of travel, soon led them to retire from the proximity of such continual danger. It was undoubtedly due to this cause that the number seen by parties who crossed the plains in 1849 and subsequently, was surprisingly small. But, fortunately for the buffaloes, the pioneers who would gladly have halted and turned aside now and then for the excitement of the chase, were compelled to hurry on, and accomplish the long journey while good weather lasted. It was owing to this fact, and the scarcity of good horses, that the buffaloes found it necessary to retire only a few miles from the wagon route to get beyond the reach of those who would have gladly hunted them. Mr. Allen Varner, of Indianola, Illinois, has kindly furnished me with the following facts in regard to the presence of the buffalo, as observed by him during his journey westward, over what was then known as the Oregon Trail. \"The old Oregon trail ran from Independence, Missouri, to old Fort Laramie, through the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains, and thence up to Salt Lake City. We left Independence on May C, 1849, and struck the Platte River at Grand Island. The trail had been traveled but very little previous to that year. We saw no buffaloes whatever until we reached the forks of the Platte, on May 20, or thereabouts. There we saw seventeen head. From that time on we saw small bunches now and then; never more than forty or fifty together. We saw no great herds anywhere, and I should say we did not see over five hundred head all told. The most western point at which we saw buffaloes was about due north of Laramie Peak, and it must have been about the 20th of June. We killed several head for meat during our trip, and found them all rather thin in flesh. Plainsmen who claimed to know, said that all the buffaloes we saw had wintered in that locality, and had not had time to get fat. The annual migration from the south had not yet begun, or rather had not yet brought any of the southern buffaloes that far north.\" In a few years the tide of overland travel became so great, that the buffaloes learned to keep away from the dangers of the trail, and many a pioneer has crossed the plains without ever seeing a live buffalo. 4. _The division of the universal herd._--Until the building of the first transcontinental railway made it possible to market the \"buffalo product,\" buffalo hunting as a business was almost wholly in the hands of the Indians. Even then, the slaughter so far exceeded the natural increase that the narrowing limits of the buffalo range was watched with anxiety, and the ultimate extinction of the species confidently predicted. Even without railroads the extermination of the race would have taken place eventually, but it would have been delayed perhaps twenty years. With a recklessness of the future that was not to be expected of savages, though perhaps perfectly natural to civilized white men, who place the possession of a dollar above everything else, the Indians with one accord singled out the _cows_ for slaughter, because their robes and their flesh better suited the fastidious taste of the noble redskin. The building of the Union Pacific Railway began at Omaha in 1865, and during that year 40 miles were constructed. The year following saw the completion of 265 miles more, and in 1867 245 miles were added, which brought it to Cheyenne. In 1868, 350 miles were built, and in 1869 the entire line was open to traffic. In 1867, when Maj. J. W. Powell and Prof. A. H. Thompson crossed the plains by means of the Union Pacific Railway as far as it was constructed and thence onward by wagon, they saw during the entire trip only one live buffalo, a solitary old bull, wandering aimlessly along the south bank of the Platte River. The completion of the Union Pacific Railway divided forever the buffaloes of the United States into two great herds, which thereafter became known respectively as the northern and southern herds. Both retired rapidly and permanently from the railway, and left a strip of country over 50 miles wide almost uninhabited by them. Although many thousand buffaloes were killed by hunters who made the Union Pacific Railway their base of operations, the two great bodies retired north and south so far that the greater number were beyond striking distance from that line. 5. _The destruction of the southern herd._--The geographical center of the great southern herd during the few years of its separate existence previous to its destruction was very near the present site of Garden City, Kansas. On the east, even as late as 1872, thousands of buffaloes ranged within 10 miles of Wichita, which was then the headquarters of a great number of buffalo-hunters, who plied their occupation vigorously during the winter. On the north the herd ranged within 25 miles of the Union Pacific, until the swarm of hunters coming down from the north drove them farther and farther south. On the west, a few small bands ranged as far as Pike\\'s Peak and the South Park, but the main body ranged east of the town of Pueblo, Colorado. In the southwest, buffaloes were abundant as far as the Pecos and the Staked Plains, while the southern limit of the herd was about on a line with the southern boundary of New Mexico. Regarding this herd, Colonel Dodge writes as follows: \"Their most prized feeding ground was the section of country between the South Platte and Arkansas rivers, watered by the Republican, Smoky, Walnut, Pawnee, and other parallel or tributary streams, and generally known as the Republican country. Hundreds of thousands went south from here each winter, but hundreds of thousands remained. It was the chosen home of the buffalo.\" Although the range of the northern herd covered about twice as much territory as did the southern, the latter contained probably twice as many buffaloes. The number of individuals in the southern herd in the year 1871 must have been at least three millions, and most estimates place the total much higher than that. During the years from 1866 to 1871, inclusive, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railway and what is now known as the Kansas Pacific, or Kansas division of the Union Pacific Railway, were constructed from the Missouri River westward across Kansas, and through the heart of the southern buffalo range. The southern herd was literally cut to pieces by railways, and every portion of its range rendered easily accessible. There had always been a market for buffalo robes at a fair price, and as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country the slaughter began. The rush to the range was only surpassed by the rush to the gold mines of California in earlier years. The railroad builders, teamsters, fortune-seekers, \"professional\" hunters, trappers, guides, and every one out of a job turned out to hunt buffalo for hides and meat. The merchants who had already settled in all the little towns along the three great railways saw an opportunity to make money out of the buffalo product, and forthwith began to organize and supply hunting parties with arms, ammunition, and provisions, and send them to the range. An immense business of this kind was done by the merchants of Dodge City (Fort Dodge), Wichita, and Leavenworth, and scores of smaller towns did a corresponding amount of business in the same line. During the years 1871 to 1874 but little else was done in that country except buffalo killing. Central depots were established in the best buffalo country, from whence hunting parties operated in all directions. Buildings were erected for the curing of meat, and corrals were built in which to heap up the immense piles of buffalo skins that accumulated. At Dodge City, as late as 1878, Professor Thompson saw a lot of baled buffalo skins in a corral, the solid cubical contents of which he calculated to equal 120 cords. At first the utmost wastefulness prevailed. Every one wanted to kill buffalo, and no one was willing to do the skinning and curing. Thousands upon thousands of buffaloes were killed for their tongues alone, and never skinned. Thousands more were wounded by unskillful marksmen and wandered off to die and become a total loss. But the climax of wastefulness and sloth was not reached until the enterprising buffalo-butcher began to skin his dead buffaloes by horse-power. The process is of interest, as showing the depth of degradation to which a man can fall and still call himself a hunter. The skin of the buffalo was ripped open along the belly and throat, the legs cut around at the knees, and ripped up the rest of the way. The skin of the neck was divided all the way around at the back of the head, and skinned back a few inches to afford a start. A stout iron bar, like a hitching post, was then driven through the skull and about 18 inches into the earth, after which a rope was tied very firmly to the thick skin of the neck, made ready for that purpose. The other end of this rope was then hitched to the whiffletree of a pair of horses, or to the rear axle of a wagon, the horses were whipped up, and the skin was forthwith either torn in two or torn off the buffalo with about 50 pounds of flesh adhering to it. It soon became apparent to even the most enterprising buffalo skinner that this method was not an unqualified success, and it was presently abandoned. The slaughter which began in 1871 was prosecuted with great vigor and enterprise in 1872, and reached its heighten 1873. By that time, the buffalo country fairly swarmed with hunters, each, party putting forth its utmost efforts to destroy more buffaloes than its rivals. By that time experience had taught the value of thorough organization, and the butchering was done in a more business-like way. By a coincidence that proved fatal to the bison, it was just at the beginning of the slaughter that breech-loading, long-range rifles attained what was practically perfection. The Sharps 40-90 or 45-120, and the Remington were the favorite weapons of the buffalo-hunter, the former being the one in most general use. Before the leaden hail of thousands of these deadly breech-loaders the buffaloes went down at the rate of several thousand daily during the hunting season. During the years 1871 and 1872 the most wanton wastefulness prevailed. Colonel Dodge declares that, though hundreds of thousands of skins were sent to market, they scarcely indicated the extent of the slaughter. Through want of skill in shooting and want of knowledge in preserving the hides of those slain by green hunters, _one hide sent to market represented three, four, or even five dead buffalo_. The skinners and curers knew so little of the proper mode of curing hides, that at least half of those actually taken were lost. In the summer and fall of 1872 one hide sent to market represented at least _three_ dead buffalo. This condition of affairs rapidly improved; but such was the furor for slaughter, and the ignorance of all concerned, that every hide sent to market in 1871 represented no less than _five_ dead buffalo. By 1873 the condition of affairs had somewhat improved, through better organization of the hunting parties and knowledge gained by experience in curing. For all that, however, buffaloes were still so exceedingly plentiful, and shooting was so much easier than skinning, the latter was looked upon as a necessary evil and still slighted to such an extent that every hide actually sold and delivered represented two dead buffaloes. In 1874 the slaughterers began to take alarm at the increasing scarcity of buffalo, and the skinners, having a much smaller number of dead animals to take care of than ever before, were able to devote more time to each subject and do their work properly. As a result, Colonel Dodge estimated that during 1874, and from that time on, one hundred skins delivered represented not more than one hundred and twenty-five dead buffaloes; but that \"no parties have ever got the proportion lower than this.\" The great southern herd was slaughtered by still-hunting, a method which has already been fully described. A typical hunting party is thus described by Colonel Dodge:[64] \"The most approved party consisted of four men--one shooter, two skinners, and one man to cook, stretch hides, and take care of camp. Where buffalo were very plentiful the number of skinners was increased. A light wagon, drawn by two horses or mules, takes the outfit into the wilderness, and brings into camp the skins taken each day. The outfit is most meager: a sack of flour, a side of bacon, 5 pounds of coffee, tea, and sugar, a little salt, and possibly a few beans, is a month\\'s supply. A common or \"A\" tent furnishes shelter; a couple of blankets for each man is a bed. One or more of Sharps or Remington\\'s heaviest sporting rifles, and an unlimited supply of ammunition, is the armament; while a coffee-pot, Dutch-oven, frying-pan, four tin plates, and four tin cups constitute the kitchen and table furniture. \"The skinning knives do duty at the platter, and \\'fingers were made before forks.\\' Nor must be forgotten one or more 10-gallon kegs for water, as the camp may of necessity be far away from a stream. The supplies are generally furnished by the merchant for whom the party is working, who, in addition, pays each of the party a specified percentage of the value of the skins delivered. The shooter is carefully selected for his skill and knowledge of the habits of the buffalo. He is captain and leader of the party. When all is ready, he plunges into the wilderness, going to the center of the best buffalo region known to him, not already occupied (for there are unwritten regulations recognized as laws, giving to each hunter certain rights of discovery and occupancy). Arrived at the position, he makes his camp in some hidden ravine or thicket, and makes all ready for work.\" [Note 64: Plains of the Great West, p. 134.] Of course the slaughter was greatest along the lines of the three great railways--the Kansas Pacific, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé, and the Union Pacific, about in the order named. It reached its height in the season of 1873. During that year the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad carried out of the buffalo country 251,443 robes, 1,017,600 pounds of meat, and 2,743,100 pounds of bones. The end of the southern herd was then near at hand. Could the southern buffalo range have been roofed over at that time it would have made one vast charnel-house. Putrifying carcasses, many of them with the hide still on, lay thickly scattered over thousands of square miles of the level prairie, poisoning the air and water and offending the sight. The remaining herds had become mere scattered bands, harried and driven hither and thither by the hunters, who now swarmed almost as thickly as the buffaloes. A cordon of camps was established along the Arkansas River, the South Platte, the Republican, and the few other streams that contained water, and when the thirsty animals came to drink they were attacked and driven away, and with the most fiendish persistency kept from slaking their thirst, so that they would again be compelled to seek the river and come within range of the deadly breech-loaders. Colonel Dodge declares that in places favorable to such warfare, as the south bank of the Platte, a herd of buffalo has, by shooting at it by day and by lighting fires and firing guns at night, been kept from water until it has been entirely destroyed. In the autumn of 1873, when Mr. William Blackmore traveled for some 30 or 40 miles along the north bank of the Arkansas River to the east of Port Dodge, \"there was a continuous line of putrescent carcasses, so that the air was rendered pestilential and offensive to the last degree. The hunters had formed a line of camps along the banks of the river, and had shot down the buffalo, night and morning, as they came to drink. In order to give an idea of the number of these carcasses, it is only necessary to mention that I counted sixty-seven on one spot not covering 4 acres.\" White hunters were not allowed to hunt in the Indian Territory, but the southern boundary of the State of Kansas was picketed by them, and a herd no sooner crossed the line going north than it was destroyed. Every water-hole was guarded by a camp of hunters, and whenever a thirsty herd approached, it was promptly met by rifle-bullets. During this entire period the slaughter of buffaloes was universal. The man who desired buffalo meat for food almost invariably killed five times as many animals as he could utilize, and after cutting from each victim its very choicest parts--the _tongue alone_, possibly, or perhaps the hump and hind quarters, one or the other, or both--fully four-fifths of the really edible portion of the carcass would be left to the wolves. It was no uncommon thing for a man to bring in two barrels of salted buffalo tongues, without another pound of meat or a solitary robe. The tongues were purchased at 25 cents each and sold in the markets farther east at 50 cents. In those days of criminal wastefulness it was a very common thing for buffaloes to be slaughtered for their tongues alone. Mr. George Catlin[65] relates that a few days previous to his arrival at the mouth of the Tetón River (Dakota), in 1832, \"an immense herd of buffaloes had showed themselves on the opposite side of the river,\" whereupon a party of five or six hundred Sioux Indians on horseback forded the river, attacked the herd, recrossed the river about sunset, and came into the fort with fourteen hundred fresh buffalo tongues, which were thrown down in a mass, and for which they required only a few gallons of whisky, which was soon consumed in \"a little harmless carouse.\" Mr. Catlin states that from all that he could learn not a skin or a pound of meat, other than the tongues, was saved after this awful slaughter. [Note 65: North American Indians, I, 256.] Judging from all accounts, it is making a safe estimate to say that probably no fewer than fifty thousand buffaloes have been killed for their tongues alone, and the most of these are undoubtedly chargeable against white men, who ought to have known better. A great deal has been said about the slaughter of buffaloes by foreign sportsmen, particularly Englishmen; but I must say that, from all that can be ascertained on this point, this element of destruction has been greatly exaggerated and overestimated. It is true that every English sportsman who visited this country in the days of the buffalo always resolved to have, and did have, \"a buffalo hunt,\" and usually under the auspices of United States Army officers. Undoubtedly these parties did kill hundreds of buffaloes, but it is very doubtful whether the aggregate of the number slain by foreign sportsmen would run up higher than ten thousand. Indeed, for myself, I am well convinced that there are many old ex-still-hunters yet living, each of whom is accountable for a greater number of victims than all buffaloes killed by foreign sportsmen would make added together. The professional butchers were very much given to crying out against \"them English lords,\" and holding up their hands in holy horror at buffaloes killed by them for their heads, instead of for hides to sell at a dollar apiece; but it is due the American public to say that all this outcry was received at its true value and deceived very few. By those in possession of the facts it was recognized as \"a blind,\" to divert public opinion from the real culprits. Nevertheless it is very true that many men who were properly classed as sportsmen, in contradistinction from the pot-hunters, did engage in useless and inexcusable slaughter to an extent that was highly reprehensible, to say the least. A sportsman is not supposed to kill game wantonly, when it can be of no possible use to himself or any one else, but a great many do it for all that. Indeed, the sportsman who kills sparingly and conscientiously is rather the exception than the rule. Colonel Dodge thus refers to the work of some foreign sportsmen: \"In the fall of that year [1872] three English gentlemen went out with me for a short hunt, and in their excitement bagged more buffalo than would have supplied a brigade.\" As a general thing, however, the professional sportsmen who went out to have a buffalo hunt for the excitement of the chase and the trophies it yielded, nearly always found the bison so easy a victim, and one whose capture brought so little glory to the hunter, that the chase was voted very disappointing, and soon abandoned in favor of nobler game. In those days there was no more to boast of in killing a buffalo than in the assassination of a Texas steer. It was, then, the hide-hunters, white and red, but especially white, who wiped out the great southern herd in four short years. The prices received for hides varied considerably, according to circumstances, but for the green or undressed article it usually ranged from 50 cents for the skins of calves to $1.25 for those of adult animals in good condition. Such prices seem ridiculously small, but when it is remembered that, when buffaloes were plentiful it was no uncommon thing for a hunter to kill from forty to sixty head in a day, it will readily be seen that the _chances_ of making very handsome profits were sufficient to tempt hunters to make extraordinary exertions. Moreover, even when the buffaloes were nearly gone, the country was overrun with men who had absolutely nothing else to look to as a means of livelihood, and so, no matter whether the profits were great or small, so long as enough buffaloes remained to make it possible to get a living by their pursuit, they were hunted down with the most determined persistency and pertinacity. 6. _Statistics of the slaughter._--The most careful and reliable estimate ever made of results of the slaughter of the southern buffalo herd is that of Col. Richard Irving Dodge, and it is the only one I know of which furnishes a good index of the former size of that herd. Inasmuch as this calculation was based on actual statistics, supplemented by personal observations and inquiries made in that region during the great slaughter, I can do no better than to quote Colonel Dodge almost in full.[66] [Note 66: Plains of the Great West, pp. 139-144.] The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad furnished the following statistics of the buffalo product carried by it during the years 1872, 1873, and 1874: +----------------------------------------------------+ | _Buffalo product._ | +----------------------------------------------------+ | | No. of skins | | | |Year. | carried. | Meat carried. | Bone carried.| +----------------------------------------------------+ | | | Pounds. | Pounds. | |1872 | 165,721 | ... | 1,135,300 | |1873 | 251,443 | 1,617,600 | 2,743,100 | |1874 | 42,289 | 632,800 | 6,914,950 | +------|--------------|---------------|--------------+ |Total | 459,453 | 2,250,400 | 10,793,350 | +----------------------------------------------------+ The officials of the Kansas Pacific and Union Pacific railroads either could not or would not furnish any statistics of the amount of the buffalo product carried by their lines during this period, and it became necessary to proceed without the actual figures in both cases. Inasmuch as the Kansas Pacific road cuts through a portion of the buffalo country which was in every respect as thickly inhabited by those animals as the region traversed by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé, it seemed absolutely certain that the former road hauled out fully as many hides as the latter, if not more, and its quota is so set down. The Union Pacific line handled a much smaller number of buffalo hides than either of its southern rivals, but Colonel Dodge believes that this, \"with the smaller roads which touch the buffalo region, taken together, carried about as much as either of the two principal buffalo roads.\" Colonel Dodge considers it reasonably certain that the statistics furnished by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé road represent only one-third of the entire buffalo product, and there certainly appears to be good ground for this belief. It is therefore in order to base further calculations upon these figures. According to evidence gathered on the spot by Colonel Dodge during the period of the great slaughter, one hide sent to market in 1872 represented three dead buffaloes, in 1873 two, and in 1874 one hundred skins delivered represented one hundred and twenty-five dead animals. The total slaughter by white men was therefore about as below: +---------------------------------------------------------------+ |Year.|Hides |Hides |Total |Total |Total | | |shipped |shipped |number of |number |of buffaloes| | |by A., T.|by other |buffaloes |killed and|slaughtered | | |and S.

In the summer they killed for the hairless hides to use for lodges and for leather, and in the autumn they slaughtered for robes and meat, but particularly robes, which were all they could offer the white trader in exchange for his goods. They were too lazy and shiftless to cure much buffalo meat, and besides it was not necessary, for the Government fed them. In regard to the number of buffaloes of the southern herd killed by the Indians, Colonel Dodge arrives at an estimate, as follows: \"It is much more difficult to estimate the number of dead buffalo represented by the Indian-tanned skins or robes sent to market. This number varies with the different tribes, and their greater or less contact with the whites. Thus, the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and Kiowas of the southern plains, having less contact with whites, use skins for their lodges, clothing, bedding, par-fléches, saddles, lariats, for almost everything. The number of robes sent to market represent only what we may call the foreign exchange of these tribes, and is really not more than one-tenth of the skins taken. To be well within bounds I will assume that one robe sent to market by these Indians represents six dead buffaloes. \"Those bands of Sioux who live at the agencies, and whose peltries are taken to market by the Union Pacific Railroad, live in lodges of cotton cloth furnished by the Indian Bureau. They use much civilized clothing, bedding, boxes, ropes, etc. For these luxuries they must pay in robes, and as the buffalo range is far from wide, and their yearly \\'crop\\' small, more than half of it goes to market.\" Leaving out of the account at this point all consideration of the killing done north of the Union Pacific Railroad, Colonel Dodge\\'s figures are as follows: _Southern buffaloes slaughtered by southern Indians._ +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | |Sent to |No. of dead | | Indians. |market. |buffaloes | | | |represented.| +-----------------------------------------+----------+------------+ | | | | |Kiowas, Comanches, Cheyennes, Arapahoes, | | | |and other Indians whose robes go over the| | | |Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad | 19,000 | 114,000 | |Sioux at agencies, Union Pacific Railroad| 10,000 | 16,000 | | +----------+------------+ |Total slaughtered per annum | 29,000 | 130,000 | |Total for the three years 1872-1874 | ... | 390,000 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ Reference has already been made to the fact that during those years an immense number of buffaloes were killed by the farmers of eastern Kansas and Nebraska for their meat. Mr. William Mitchell, of Wabaunsee, Kansas, stated to the writer that \"in those days, when buffaloes were plentiful in western Kansas, pretty much everybody made a trip West in the fall and brought back a load of buffalo meat. Everybody had it in abundance as long as buffaloes remained in any considerable number. Very few skins were saved; in fact, hardly any, for the reason that nobody knew how to tan them, and they always spoiled. At first a great many farmers tried to dress the green hides that they brought back, but they could not succeed, and finally gave up trying. Of course, a great deal of the meat killed was wasted, for only the best parts were brought back.\" The Wichita (Kansas) _World_ of February 9, 1889, contains the following reference: \"In 1871 and 1872 the buffalo ranged within 10 miles of Wichita, and could be counted by the thousands. The town, then in its infancy, was the headquarters for a vast number of buffalo-hunters, who plied their occupation vigorously during the winter. The buffalo were killed principally for their hides, and daily wagon trains arrived in town loaded with them. Meat was very cheap in those days; fine, tender buffalo steak selling from 1 to 2 cents per pound. * * * The business was quite profitable for a time, but a sudden drop in the price of hides brought them down as low as 25 and 50 cents each. * * * It was a very common thing in those days for people living in Wichita to start out in the morning and return by evening with a wagon load of buffalo meat.\" Unquestionably a great many thousand buffaloes were killed annually by the settlers of Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado, and the mountain Indians living west of the great range. The number so slain can only be guessed at, for there is absolutely no data on which to found an estimate. Judging merely from the number of people within reach of the range, it may safely be estimated that the total number of buffaloes slaughtered annually to satisfy the wants of this heterogeneous element could not have been less than fifty thousand, and probably was a much higher number. This, for the three years, would make one hundred and fifty thousand, and the grand total would therefore be about as follows: +------------------------------------------------------+ | _The slaughter of the southern herd._ | +------------------------------------------------------+ |Killed by \"professional\" white hunters in | | | 1872, 1873, and 1874 | 3,158,730 | |Killed by Indians, same period | 390,000 | |Killed by settlers and mountain Indians | 150,000 | | | --------- | | Total slaughter in three years | 3,098,730 | +------------------------------------------------------+ These figures seem incredible, but unfortunately there is not the slightest reason for believing they are too high. There are many men now living who declare that during the great slaughter they each killed from twenty-five hundred to three thousand buffaloes every year. With thousands of hunters on the range, and such possibilities of slaughter before each, it is, after all, no wonder that an average of nearly a million and a quarter of buffaloes fell each year during that bloody period. By the close of the hunting season of 1875 the great southern herd had ceased to exist. As a body, it had been utterly annihilated. The main body of the survivors, numbering about ten thousand head, fled southwest, and dispersed through that great tract of wild, desolate, and inhospitable country stretching southward from the Cimarron country across the \"Public Land Strip,\" the Pan-handle of Texas, and the Llano Estacado, or Staked Plain, to the Pecos River. A few small bands of stragglers maintained a precarious existence for a few years longer on the headwaters of the Republican River and in southwestern Nebraska, near Ogalalla, where calves were caught alive as late as 1885. Wild buffaloes were seen in southwestern Kansas for the last time in 1886, and the two or three score of individuals still living in the Canadian River country of the Texas Pan-handle are the last wild survivors of the great Southern herd. The main body of the fugitives which survived the great slaughter of 1871-\\'74 continued to attract hunters who were very \"hard up,\" who pursued them, often at the risk of their own lives, even into the terrible Llano Estacado. In Montana in 1886 I met on a cattle ranch an ex-buffalo-hunter from Texas, named Harry Andrews, who from 1874 to 1876 continued in pursuit of the scattered remnants of the great southern herd through the Pan-handle of Texas and on into the Staked Plain itself. By that time the market had become completely overstocked with robes, and the prices received by Andrews and other hunters was only 65 cents each for cow robes and $1.15 each for bull robes, delivered on the range, the purchaser providing for their transportation to the railway. But even at those prices, which were so low as to make buffalo killing seem like downright murder, Mr. Andrews assured me that he \"made big money.\" On one occasion, when he \"got a stand\" on a large bunch of buffalo, he fired one hundred and fifteen shots from one spot, and killed sixty-three buffaloes in about an hour. In 1880 buffalo hunting as a business ceased forever in the Southwest, and so far as can be ascertained, but one successful hunt for robes has been made in that region since that time. That occurred in the fall and winter of 1887, about 100 miles north of Tascosa, Texas, when two parties, one of which was under the leadership of Lee Howard, attacked the only band of buffaloes left alive in the Southwest, and which at that time numbered about two hundred head. The two parties killed fifty-two buffaloes, of which ten skins were preserved entire for mounting. Of the remaining forty-two, the heads were cut off and preserved for mounting and the skins were prepared as robes. The mountable skins were finally sold at the following prices: Young cows, $50 to $60; adult cows, $75 to $100; adult bull, $150. The unmounted heads sold as follows: Young bulls, $25 to $30; adult bulls, $50; young cows, $10 to $12; adult cows, $15 to $25. A few of the choicest robes sold at $20 each, and the remainder, a lot of twenty eight, of prime quality and in excellent condition, were purchased by the Hudson\\'s Bay Fur Company for $350. Such was the end of the great southern herd. In 1871 it contained certainly no fewer than three million buffaloes, and by the beginning of 1875 its existence as a herd had utterly ceased, and nothing but scattered, fugitive bands remained. 7. _The Destruction of the Northern Herd._--Until the building of the Northern Pacific Railway there were but two noteworthy outlets for the buffalo robes that were taken annually in the Northwestern Territories of the United States. The principal one was the Missouri River, and the Yellowstone River was the other. Down these streams the hides were transported by steam-boats to the nearest railway shipping point. For fifty years prior to the building of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1880-\\'82, the number of robes marketed every year by way of these streams was estimated variously at from fifty to one hundred thousand. A great number of hides taken in the British Possessions fell into the hands of the Hudson\\'s Bay Company, and found a market in Canada. In May, 1881, the Sioux City (Iowa) _Journal_ contained the following information in regard to the buffalo robe \"crop\" of the previous hunting season--the winter of 1880-\\'81: \"It is estimated by competent authorities that one hundred thousand buffalo hides will be shipped out of the Yellowstone country this season. Two firms alone are negotiating for the transportation of twenty-five thousand hides each. * * * Most of our citizens saw the big load of buffalo hides that the _C. K. Peck_ brought down last season, a load that hid everything about the boat below the roof of the hurricane deck. There were ten thousand hides in that load, and they were all brought out of the Yellowstone on one trip and transferred to the _C. K. Peck_. How such a load could have been piled on the little _Terry_ not even the men on the boat appear to know. It hid every part of the boat, barring only the pilot-house and smoke-stacks. But such a load will not be attempted again. For such boats as ply the Yellowstone there are at least fifteen full loads of buffalo hides and other pelts. Reckoning one thousand hides to three car loads, and adding to this fifty cars for the other pelts, it will take at least three hundred and fifty box-cars to carry this stupendous bulk of peltry East to market. These figures are not guesses, but estimates made by men whose business it is to know about the amount of hides and furs awaiting shipment. \"Nothing like it has ever been known in the history of the fur trade. Last season the output of buffalo hides was above the average, and last year only about thirty thousand hides came out of the Yellowstone country, or less than a third of what is there now awaiting shipment The past severe winter caused the buffalo to bunch themselves in a few valleys where there was pasturage, and there the slaughter went on all winter. There was no sport about it, simply shooting down the famine-tamed animals as cattle might be shot down in a barn-yard. To the credit of the Indians it can be said that they killed no more than they could save the meat from. The greater part of the slaughter was done by white hunters, or butchers rather, who followed the business of killing and skinning buffalo by the mouth, leaving the carcasses to rot.\" At the time of the great division made by the Union Pacific Railway the northern body of buffalo extended from the valley of the Platte River northward to the southern shore of Great Slave Lake, eastward almost to Minnesota, and westward to an elevation of 8,000 feet in the Rocky Mountains. The herds were most numerous along the central portion of this region (see map), and from the Platte Valley to Great Slave Lake the range was continuous. The buffalo population of the southern half of this great range was, according to all accounts, nearly three times as great as that of the northern half. At that time, or, let us say, 1870, there were about four million buffaloes south of the Platte River, and probably about one million and a half north of it. I am aware that the estimate of the number of buffaloes in the great northern herd is usually much higher than this, but I can see no good grounds for making it so. To my mind, the evidence is conclusive that, although the northern herd ranged over such an immense area, it was numerically less than half the size of the overwhelming multitude which actually crowded the southern range, and at times so completely consumed the herbage of the plains that detachments of the United States Army found it difficult to find sufficient grass for their mules and horses.[67] [Note 67: As an instance of this, see _Forest and Stream_, vol. II, p. 184: \"Horace Jones, the interpreter here [Fort Sill], says that on his first trip along the line of the one hundredth meridian, in 1859, accompanying Major Thomas--since our noble old general--they passed continuous herds for over 60 miles, which left so little grass behind them that Major Thomas was seriously troubled about his horses.\"] The various influences which ultimately led to the complete blotting out of the great northern herd were exerted about as follows: In the British Possessions, where the country was immense and game of all kinds except buffalo very scarce indeed; where, in the language of Professor Kenaston, the explorer, \"there was a great deal of country around every wild animal,\" the buffalo constituted the main dependence of the Indians, who would not cultivate the soil at all, and of the half-breeds, who would not so long as they could find buffalo. Under such circumstances the buffaloes of the British Possessions were hunted much more vigorously and persistently than those of the United States, where there was such an abundant supply of deer, elk, antelope, and other game for the Indians to feed upon, and a paternal government to support them with annuities besides. Quite contrary to the prevailing idea of the people of the United States, viz., that there were great herds of buffaloes in existence in the Saskatchewan country long after ours had all been destroyed, the herds of British America had been almost totally exterminated by the time the final slaughter of our northern herd was inaugurated by the opening of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1880. The Canadian Pacific Railway played no part whatever in the extermination of the bison in the British Possessions, for it had already taken place. The half-breeds of Manitoba, the Plains Crees of Qu\\'Appelle, and the Blackfeet of the South Saskatchewan country swept bare a great belt of country stretching east and west between the Rocky Mountains and Manitoba. The Canadian Pacific Railway found only bleaching bones in the country through which it passed. The buffalo had disappeared from that entire region before 1879 and left the Blackfeet Indians on the verge of starvation. A few thousand buffaloes still remained in the country around the headwaters of the Battle River, between the North and South Saskatchewan, but they were surrounded and attacked from all sides, and their numbers diminished very rapidly until all were killed. The latest information I have been able to obtain in regard to the disappearance of this northern band has been kindly furnished by Prof. C. A. Kenaston, who in 1881, and also in 1883, made a thorough exploration of the country between Winnipeg and Fort Edmonton for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. His four routes between the two points named covered a vast scope of country, several hundred miles in width. In 1881, at Moose Jaw, 75 miles southeast of The Elbow of the South Saskatchewan, he saw a party of Cree Indians, who had just arrived from the northwest with several carts laden with fresh buffalo meat. At Fort Saskatchewan, on the North Saskatchewan River, just above Edmonton, he saw a party of English sportsmen who had recently been hunting on the Battle and Red Deer Rivers, between Edmonton and Fort Kalgary, where they had found buffaloes, and killed as many as they cared to slaughter. In one afternoon they killed fourteen, and could have killed more had they been more blood-thirsty. In 1883 Professor Kenaston found the fresh trail of a band of twenty-five or thirty buffaloes at The Elbow of the South Saskatchewan. Excepting in the above instances he saw no further traces of buffalo, nor did he hear of the existence of any in all the country he explored. In 1881 he saw many Cree Indians at Fort Qu\\'Appelle in a starving condition, and there was no pemmican or buffalo meat at the fort. In 1883, however, a little pemmican found its way to Winnipeg, where it sold at 15 cents per pound; an exceedingly high price. It had been made that year, evidently in the mouth of April, as he purchased it in May for his journey. The first really alarming impression made on our northern herd was by the Sioux Indians, who very speedily exterminated that portion of it which had previously covered the country lying between the North Platte and a line drawn from the center of Wyoming to the center of Dakota. All along the Missouri River from Bismarck to Fort Benton, and along the Yellowstone to the head of navigation, the slaughter went bravely on. All the Indian tribes of that vast region--Sioux, Cheyennes, Crows, Blackfeet, Bloods, Piegans, Assinniboines, Gros Ventres, and Shoshones--found their most profitable business and greatest pleasure (next to scalping white settlers) in hunting the buffalo. It took from eight to twelve buffalo hides to make a covering for one ordinary teepee, and sometimes a single teepee of extra size required from twenty to twenty-five hides. The Indians of our northwestern Territories marketed about seventy-five thousand buffalo robes every year so long as the northern herd was large enough to afford the supply. If we allow that for every skin sold to white traders four others were used in supplying their own wants, which must be considered a very moderate estimate, the total number of buffaloes slaughtered annually by those tribes must have been about three hundred and seventy-five thousand. The end which so many observers had for years been predicting really began (with the northern herd) in 1876, two years after the great annihilation which had taken place in the South, although it was not until four years later that the slaughter became universal over the entire range. It is very clearly indicated in the figures given in a letter from Messrs. I. G. Baker & Co., of Fort Benton, Montana, to the writer, dated October 6, 1887, which reads as follows: \"There were sent East from the year 1876 from this point about seventy-five thousand buffalo robes. In 1880 it had fallen to about twenty thousand, in 1883 not more than five thousand, and in 1884 none whatever. We are sorry we can not give you a better record, but the collection of hides which exterminated the buffalo was from the Yellowstone country on the Northern Pacific, instead of northern Montana.\" The beginning of the final slaughter of our northern herd may be dated about 1880, by which time the annual robe crop of the Indians had diminished three-fourths, and when summer killing for hairless hides began on a large scale. The range of this herd was surrounded on three sides by tribes of Indians, armed with breech-loading rifles and abundantly supplied with fixed ammunition. Up to the year 1880 the Indians of the tribes previously mentioned killed probably three times as many buffaloes as did the white hunters, and had there not been a white hunter in the whole Northwest the buffalo would have been exterminated there just as surely, though not so quickly by perhaps ten years, as actually occurred. Along the north, from the Missouri River to the British line, and from the reservation in northwestern Dakota to the main divide of the Rocky Mountains, a distance of 550 miles as the crow flies, the country was one continuous Indian reservation, inhabited by eight tribes, who slaughtered buffalo in season and out of season, in winter for robes and in summer for hides and meat to dry. In the Southeast was the great body of Sioux, and on the Southwest the Crows and Northern Cheyennes, all engaged in the same relentless warfare. It would have required a body of armed men larger than the whole United States Army to have withstood this continuous hostile pressure without ultimate annihilation. Let it be remembered, therefore, that the American Indian is as much responsible for the extermination of our northern herd of bison as the American citizen. I have yet to learn of an instance wherein an Indian refrained from excessive slaughter of game through motives of economy, or care for the future, or prejudice against wastefulness. From all accounts the quantity of game killed by an Indian has always been limited by two conditions only--lack of energy to kill more, or lack of more game to be killed. White men delight in the chase, and kill for the \"sport\" it yields, regardless of the effort involved. Indeed, to a genuine sportsman, nothing in hunting is \"sport\" which is not obtained at the cost of great labor. An Indian does not view the matter in that light, and when he has killed enough to supply his wants, he stops, because he sees no reason why he should exert himself any further. This has given rise to the statement, so often repeated, that the Indian killed only enough buffaloes to supply his wants. If an Indian ever attempted, or even showed any inclination, to husband the resources of nature in any way, and restrain wastefulness on _the part of Indians_, it would be gratifying to know of it. The building of the Northern Pacific Railway across Dakota and Montana hastened the end that was fast approaching; but it was only an incident in the annihilation of the northern herd. Without it the final result would have been just the same, but the end would probably not have been reached until about 1888. The Northern Pacific Railway reached Bismarck, Dakota, on the Missouri River, in the year 1876, and from that date onward received for transportation eastward all the buffalo robes and hides that came down the two rivers, Missouri and Yellowstone. Unfortunately the Northern Pacific Railway Company kept no separate account of its buffalo product business, and is unable to furnish a statement of the number of hides and robes it handled. It is therefore impossible to even make an estimate of the total number of buffaloes killed on the northern range during the six years which ended with the annihilation of that herd. In regard to the business done by the Northern Pacific Railway, and the precise points from whence the bulk of the robes were shipped, the following letter from Mr. J. M. Hannaford, traffic manager of the Northern Pacific Railroad, under date of September 3, 1887, is of interest. \"Your communication, addressed to President Harris, has been referred to me for the information desired. \"I regret that our accounts are not so kept as to enable me to furnish you accurate data; but I have been able to obtain the following general information, which may prove of some value to you: \"From the years 1876 and 1880 our line did not extend beyond Bismarck, which was the extreme easterly shipping point for buffalo robes and hides, they being brought down the Missouri River from the north for shipment from that point. In the years 1876, 1877, 1878, and 1879 there were handled at that point yearly from three to four thousand bales of robes, about one-half the bales containing ten robes and the other half twelve robes each. During these years practically no hides were shipped. In 1880 the shipment of hides, dry and untanned, commenced,[68] and in 1881 and 1882 our line was extended west, and the shipping points increased, reaching as far west as Terry and Sully Springs, in Montana. During these years, 1880, 1881, and 1882, which practically finished the shipments of hides and robes, it is impossible for me to give you any just idea of the number shipped. The only figures obtainable are those of 1881, when over seventy-five thousand dry and untanned buffalo hides came down the river for shipment from Bismarck. Some robes were also shipped from this point that year, and a considerable number of robes and hides were shipped from several other shipping points. [Note 68: It is to be noted that hairless hides, _taken from buffaloes killed in summer_, are what the writer refers to. It was not until 1881, when the end was very near, that hunting buffalo in summer as well as winter became a wholesale business. What hunting can be more disgraceful than the slaughter of females and young _in summer_, when skins are almost worthless.] \"The number of pounds of buffalo meat shipped over our line has never cut any figure, the bulk of the meat having been left on the prairie, as not being of sufficient value to pay the cost of transportation. \"The names of the extreme eastern and western stations from which shipments were made are as follows: In 1880, Bismarck was the only shipping point. In 1881, Glendive, Bismarck, and Beaver Creek. In 1882, Terry and Sully Springs, Montana, were the chief shipping points, and in the order named, so far as numbers and amount of shipments are concerned. Bismarck on the east and Forsyth on the west were the two extremities. \"Up to the year 1880, so long as buffalo were killed only for robes, the bands did not decrease very materially; but beginning with that year, when they were killed for their hides as well, a most indiscriminate slaughter commenced, and from that time on they disappeared very rapidly. Up to the year 1881 there were two large bands, one south of the Yellowstone and the other north of that river. In the year mentioned those south of the river were driven north and never returned, having joined the northern band, and become practically extinguished. \"Since 1882 there have, of course, been occasional shipments both of hides and robes, but in such small quantities and so seldom that they cut practically no figure, the bulk of them coming probably from north Missouri points down the river to Bismarck.\" In 1880 the northern buffalo range embraced the following streams; The Missouri and all its tributaries, from Port Shaw, Montana, to Fort Bennett, Dakota, and the Yellowstone and all its tributaries. Of this region, Miles City, Montana, was the geographical center. The grass was good over the whole of it, and the various divisions of the great herd were continually shifting from one locality to another, often making journeys several hundred miles at a time. Over the whole of this vast area their bleaching bones lie scattered (where they have not as yet been gathered up for sale) from the Upper Marias and Milk Rivers, near the British boundary, to the Platte, and from the James River, in central Dakota, to an elevation of 8,000 feet in the Rocky Mountains. Indeed, as late as October, 1887, I gathered up on the open common, within half a mile of the Northern Pacific Railway depot at the city of Helena, the skull, horns, and numerous odd bones of a large bull buffalo which had been killed there. [Illustration: WHERE THE MILLIONS HAVE GONE. From a painting by J. H. Moser in the National Museum.] Over many portions of the northern range the traveler may even now ride for days together without once being out of sight of buffalo carcasses, or bones. Such was the case in 1886 in the country lying between the Missouri and the Yellowstone, northwest of Miles City. Go wherever we might, on divides, into bad lands, creek bottoms, or on the highest plateaus, we always found the inevitable and omnipresent grim and ghastly skeleton, with hairy head, dried-up and shriveled nostrils, half-skinned legs stretched helplessly upon the gray turf, and the bones of the body bleached white as chalk. The year 1881 witnessed the same kind of a stampede for the northern buffalo range that occurred just ten years previously in the south. At that time robes were worth from two to three times as much as they ever had been in the south, the market was very active, and the successful hunter was sure to reap a rich reward as long as the buffaloes lasted. At that time the hunters and hide-buyers estimated that there were five hundred thousand buffaloes within a radius of 150 miles of Miles City, and that there were still in the entire northern herd not far from one million head. The subsequent slaughter proved that these estimates were probably not far from the truth. In that year Fort Custer was so nearly overwhelmed by a passing herd that a detachment of soldiers was ordered out to turn the herd away from the post. In 1882 an immense herd appeared on the high, level plateau on the north side of the Yellowstone which overlooks Miles City and Fort Keogh in the valley below. A squad of soldiers from the Fifth Infantry was sent up on the bluff, and in less than an hour had killed enough buffaloes to load six four-mule teams with meat. In 1886 there were still about twenty bleaching skeletons lying in a group on the edge of this plateau at the point where the road from the ferry reaches the level, but all the rest had been gathered up. In 1882 there were, so it is estimated by men who were in the country, no fewer than five thousand white hunters and skinners on the northern range. Lieut. J. M. T. Partello declares that \"a cordon of camps, from the Upper Missouri, where it bends to the west, stretched toward the setting sun as far as the dividing line of Idaho, completely blocking in the great ranges of the Milk River, the Musselshell, Yellowstone, and the Marias, and rendering it impossible for scarcely a single bison to escape through the chain of sentinel camps to the Canadian northwest. Hunters of Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado drove the poor hunted animals north, directly into the muzzles of the thousands of repeaters ready to receive them. * * * Only a few short years ago, as late as 1883, a herd of about seventy-five thousand crossed the Yellowstone River a few miles south of here [Fort Keogh], scores of Indians, pot-hunters, and white butchers on their heels, bound for the Canadian dominions, where they hoped to find a haven of safety. Alas! not five thousand of that mighty mass ever lived to reach the British border line.\" It is difficult to say (at least to the satisfaction of old hunters) which were the most famous hunting grounds on the northern range. Lieutenant Partello states that when he hunted in the great triangle bounded by the three rivers, Missouri, Musselshell, and Yellowstone, it contained, to the best of his knowledge and belief, two hundred and fifty thousand buffaloes. Unquestionably that region yielded an immense number of buffalo robes, and since the slaughter _thousands of tons_ of bones have been gathered up there. Another favorite locality was the country lying between the Powder River and the Little Missouri, particularly the valleys of Beaver and O\\'Fallon Creeks. Thither went scores of \"outfits\" and hundreds of hunters and skinners from the Northern Pacific Railway towns from Miles City to Glendive. The hunters from the towns between Glendive and Bismarck mostly went south to Cedar Creek and the Grand and Moreau Rivers. But this territory was also the hunting ground of the Sioux Indians from the great reservation farther south. Thousands upon thousands of buffaloes were killed on the Milk and Marias Rivers, in the Judith Basin, and in northern Wyoming. The method of slaughter has already been fully described under the head of \"the still-hunt,\" and need not be recapitulated. It is some gratification to know that the shocking and criminal wastefulness which was so marked a feature of the southern butchery was almost wholly unknown in the north. Robes were worth from $1.50 to $3.50, according to size and quality, and were removed and preserved with great care. Every one hundred robes marketed represented not more than one hundred and ten dead buffaloes, and even this small percentage of loss was due to the escape of wounded animals which afterward died and were devoured by the wolves. After the skin was taken off the hunter or skinner stretched it carefully upon the ground, inside uppermost, cut his initials in the adherent subcutaneous muscle, and left it until the season for hauling in the robes, which was always done in the early spring, immediately following the hunt. As was the case in the south, it was the ability of a single hunter to destroy an entire bunch of buffalo in a single day that completely annihilated the remaining thousands of the northern herd before the people of the United States even learned what was going on. For example, one hunter of my acquaintance, Vic. Smith, the most famous hunter in Montana, killed one hundred and seven buffaloes in one \"stand,\" in about one hour\\'s time, and without shifting his point of attack. This occurred in the Red Water country, about 100 miles northeast of Miles City, in the winter of 1881-\\'82. During the same season another hunter, named \"Doc.\" Aughl, killed eighty-five buffaloes at one \"stand,\" and John Edwards killed seventy-five. The total number that Smith claims to have killed that season is \"about five thousand.\" Where buffaloes were at all plentiful, every man who called himself a hunter was expected to kill between one and two thousand during the hunting season--from November to February--and when the buffaloes were to be found it was a comparatively easy thing to do. During the year 1882 the thousands of bison that still remained alive on the range indicated above, and also marked out on the accompanying map, were distributed over that entire area very generally. In February of that year a Fort Benton correspondent of _Forest and Stream_ wrote as follows: \"It is truly wonderful how many buffalo are still left. Thousands of Indians and hundreds of white men depend on them for a living. At present nearly all the buffalo in Montana are between Milk River and Bear Paw Mountains. There are only a few small bands between the Missouri and the Yellowstone.\" There were plenty of buffalo on the Upper Marias River in October, 1882. In November and December there were thousands between the Missouri and the Yellowstone Rivers. South of the Northern Pacific Railway the range during the hunting season of 1882-\\'83 was thus defined by a hunter who has since written out the \"Confessions of a Buffalo Butcher\" for _Forest and Stream_ (vol. xxiv, p. 489): \"Then [October, 1882] the western limit was defined in a general way by Powder River, and extending eastward well toward the Missouri and south to within 60 or 70 miles of the Black Hills. It embraces the valleys of all tributaries to Powder River from the east, all of the valleys of Beaver Creek, O\\'Fallon Creek, and the Little Missouri and Moreau Rivers, and both forks of the Cannon Ball for almost half their length. This immense territory, lying almost equally in Montana and Dakota, had been occupied during the winters by many thousands of buffaloes from time immemorial, and many of the cows remained during the summer and brought forth their young undisturbed.\" The three hunters composing the party whose record is narrated in the interesting sketch referred to, went out from Miles City on October 23, 1882, due east to the bad lands between the Powder River and O\\'Fallon Creek, and were on the range all winter. They found comparatively few buffaloes, and secured only two hundred and eighty-six robes, which they sold at an average price of $2.20 each. They saved and marketed a large quantity of meat, for which they obtained 3 cents per pound. They found the whole region in which they hunted fairly infested with Indians and half-breeds, all hunting buffalo. The hunting season which began in October, 1882, and ended in February, 1883, finished the annihilation of the great northern herd, and left but a few small bauds of stragglers, numbering only a very few thousand individuals all told. A noted event of the season was the retreat northward across the Yellowstone of the immense herd mentioned by Lieutenant Partello as containing seventy-five thousand head; others estimated the number at fifty thousand; and the event is often spoken of to-day by frontiersmen who were in that region at the time. Many think that the whole great body went north into British territory, and that there is still a goodly remnant of it in some remote region between the Peace River and the Saskatchewan, or somewhere there, which will yet return to the United States. Nothing could be more illusory than this belief. In the first place, the herd never reached the British line, and, if it had, it would have been promptly annihilated by the hungry Blackfeet and Cree Indians, who were declared to be in a half-starved condition, through the disappearance of the buffalo, as early as 1879. The great herd that \"went north\" was utterly extinguished by the white hunters along the Missouri River and the Indians living north of it. The only vestige of it that remained was a band of about two hundred individuals that took refuge in the labyrinth of ravines and creek bottoms that lie west of the Musselshell between Flat Willow and Box Elder Creeks, and another band of about seventy-five which settled in the bad lands between the head of the Big Dry and Big Porcupine Creeks, where a few survivors were found by the writer in 1886. South of the Northern Pacific Railway, a band of about three hundred settled permanently in and around the Yellowstone National Park, but in a very short time every animal outside of the protected limits of the park was killed, and whenever any of the park buffaloes strayed beyond the boundary they too were promptly killed for their heads and hides. At present the number remaining in the park is believed by Captain Harris, the superintendent, to be about two hundred; about one-third of which is due to breeding in the protected territory. In the southeast the fate of that portion of the herd is well known. The herd which at the beginning of the hunting season of 1883 was known to contain about ten thousand head, and ranged in western Dakota, about half way between the Black Hills and Bismarck, between the Moreau and Grand Rivers, was speedily reduced to about one thousand head. Vic. Smith, who was \"in at the death,\" says there were eleven hundred, others say twelve hundred. Just at this juncture (October, 1883) Sitting Bull and his whole band of nearly one thousand braves arrived from the Standing Sock Agency, and in two days\\' time slaughtered the entire herd. Vic. Smith and a host of white hunters took part in the killing of this last ten thousand, and he declares that \"when we got through the hunt there was not a hoof left. That wound up the buffalo in the Far West, only a stray bull being seen here and there afterwards.\" Curiously enough, not even the buffalo hunters themselves were at the time aware of the fact that the end of the hunting season of 1882-\\'83 was also the end of the buffalo, at least as an inhabitant of the plains and a source of revenue. In the autumn of 1883 they nearly all outfitted as usual, often at an expense of many hundreds of dollars, and blithely sought \"the range\" that had up to that time been so prolific in robes. The end was in nearly every case the same--total failure and bankruptcy. It was indeed hard to believe that not only the millions, but also the thousands, had actually gone, and forever. I have found it impossible to ascertain definitely the number of robes and hides shipped from the northern range during the last years of the slaughter, and the only reliable estimate I have obtained was made for me, alter much consideration and reflection, by Mr. J. N. Davis, of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Mr. Davis was for many years a buyer of furs, robes, and hides on a large scale throughout our Northwestern Territories, and was actively engaged in buying up buffalo robes as long as there were any to buy. In reply to a letter asking for statistics, he wrote me as follows, on September 27, 1887: \"It is impossible to give the exact number of robes and hides shipped out of Dakota and Montana from 1876 to 1883, or the exact number of buffalo in the northern herd; but I will give you as correct an account as any one can. In 1876 it was estimated that there were half a million buffaloes within a radius of 150 miles of Miles City. In 1881 the Northern Pacific Railroad was built as far west as Glendive and Miles City. At that time the whole country was a howling wilderness, and Indians and wild buffalo were too numerous to mention. The first shipment of buffalo robes, killed by white men, was made that year, and the stations on the Northern Pacific Railroad between Miles City and Mandan sent out about fifty thousand hides and robes. In 1882 the number of hides and robes bought and shipped was about two hundred thousand, and in 1883 forty thousand. In 1884 I shipped from Dickinson, Dakota Territory, the only car load of robes that went East that year, and it was the last shipment ever made.\" For a long time the majority of the ex-hunters cherished the fond delusion that the great herd had only \"gone north\" into the British Possessions, and would eventually return in great force. Scores of rumors of the finding of herds floated about, all of which were eagerly believed at first. But after a year or two had gone by without the appearance of a single buffalo, and likewise without any reliable information of the existence of a herd of any size, even in British territory, the butchers of the buffalo either hung up their old Sharps rifles, or sold them for nothing to the gun-dealers, and sought other means of livelihood. Some took to gathering up buffalo bones and selling them by the ton, and others became cowboys. IV. CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE BISON. The slaughter of the buffalo down to the very point of extermination has been so very generally condemned, and the general Government has been so unsparingly blamed for allowing such a massacre to take place on the public domain, it is important that the public should know all the facts in the case. To the credit of Congress it must be said that several very determined efforts were made between the years 1871 and 1876 looking toward the protection of the buffalo. The failure of all those well-meant efforts was due to our republican form of Government. Had this Government been a monarchy the buffalo would have been protected; but unfortunately in this case (perhaps the only one on record wherein a king could have accomplished more than the representatives of the people) the necessary act of Congress was so hedged in and beset by obstacles that it never became an accomplished fact. Even when both houses of Congress succeeded in passing a suitable act (June 23, 1874) it went to the President in the last days of the session only to be pigeon-holed, and die a natural death. The following is a complete history of Congressional legislation in regard to the protection of the buffalo from wanton slaughter and ultimate extinction. The first step taken in behalf of this persecuted animal was on March 13, 1871, when Mr. McCormick, of Arizona, introduced a bill (H. R. 157), which was ordered to be printed. Nothing further was done with it. It read as follows: _Be it enacted, etc._, That, excepting for the purpose of using the meat for food or preserving the akin, it shall be unlawful for any person to kill the bison, or buffalo, found anywhere upon the public lands of the United States; and for the violation of this law the offender shall, upon conviction before any court of competent jurisdiction, be liable to a fine of $100 for each animal killed, one-half of which sum shall, upon its collection, be paid to the informer. On February 14, 1872, Mr. Cole, of California, introduced in the Senate the following resolution, which was considered by unanimous consent and agreed to: _Resolved_, That the Committee on Territories be directed to inquire into the expediency of enacting a law for the protection of the buffalo, elk, antelope, and other useful animals running wild in the Territories of the United States against indiscriminate slaughter and extermination, and that they report by bill or otherwise. On February 16, 1872, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, introduced a bill in the Senate (S. 655) restricting the killing of the buffalo upon the public lauds; which was read twice by its title and referred to the Committee on Territories. On April 5, 1872, Mr. B. C. McCormick, of Arizona, made a speech in the House of Representatives, while it was in Committee of the Whole, on the restriction of the killing of buffalo. He mentioned a then recent number of _Harper\\'s Weekly_, in which were illustrations of the slaughter of buffalo, and also read a partly historical extract in regard to the same. He related how, when he was once snow-bound upon the Kansas Pacific Railroad, the buffalo furnished food for himself and fellow-passengers. Then he read the bill introduced by him March 13, 1871, and also copies of letters furnished him by Henry Bergh, president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which were sent to the latter by General W. B. Hazen, Lieut. Col. A. G. Brackett, and E. W. Wynkoop. He also read a statement by General Hazen to the effect that he knew of a man who killed ninety-nine buffaloes with his own hand in one day. He also spoke on the subject of cross-breeding the buffalo with common cattle, and read an extract in regard to it from the San Francisco _Post_.[69] [Note 69: Congressional Globe (Appendix), second session Forty-second Congress.] On April 6, 1872, Mr. McCormick asked leave to have printed in the Globe some remarks he had prepared regarding restricting the killing of buffalo, which was granted.[70] [Note 70: Congressional Globe, April 6, 1872, Forty-second Congress, second session.] On January 5, 1874, Mr. Fort, of Illinois, introduced a bill (H. R. 921) to prevent the useless slaughter of buffalo within the Territories of the United States; which was read and referred to the Committee on the Territories.[71] [Note 71: Congressional Record, vol. 2, part 1, Forty-third Congress, p. 371.] On March 10, 1874, this bill was reported to the House from the Committee on the Territories, with a recommendation that it be passed.[72] [Note 72: Congressional Record, vol. 2, part 3, Forty-third Congress, first session, pp. 2105, 2109.] The first section of the bill provided that it shall be unlawful for any person, who is not an Indian, to kill, wound, or in any way destroy any female buffalo of any age, found at large within the boundaries of any of the Territories of the United States. The second section provided that it shall be, in like manner, unlawful for any such person to kill, wound, or destroy in said Territories any greater number of male buffaloes than are needed for food by such person, or than can be used, cured, or preserved for the food of other persons, or for the market. It shall in like manner be unlawful for any such person, or persons, to assist, or be in any manner engaged or concerned in or about such unlawful killing, wounding, or destroying of any such buffaloes; that any person who shall violate the provisions of the act shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay to the United States the sum of $100 for each offense (and each buffalo so unlawfully killed, wounded, or destroyed shall be and constitute a separate offense), and on a conviction of a second offense may be committed to prison for a period not exceeding thirty days; and that all United States judges, justices, courts, and legal tribunals in said Territories shall have jurisdiction in cases of the violation of the law. Mr. Cox said he had been told by old hunters that it was impossible to tell the sex of a running buffalo; and he also stated that the bill gave preference to the Indians. Mr. Fort said the object was to prevent early extermination; that thousands were annually slaughtered for skins alone, and thousands for their tongues alone; that perhaps hundreds of thousands are killed every year in utter wantonness, with no object for such destruction. He had been told that the sexes could be distinguished while they were running.[73] [Note 73: I know of no greater affront that could be offered to the intelligence of a genuine buffalo-hunter than to accuse him of not knowing enough to tell the sex of a buffalo \"on the run\" by its form alone.--W. T. H.] This bill does not prohibit any person joining in a reasonable chase and hunt of the buffalo. Said Mr. Fort, \"So far as I am advised, gentlemen upon this floor representing all the Territories are favorable to the passage of this bill.\" Mr. Cox wanted the clause excepting the Indians from the operations of the bill stricken out, and stated that the Secretary of the Interior had already said to the House that the civilization of the Indian was Impossible while the buffalo remained on the plains. The Clerk read for Mr. McCormick the following extract from the _New Mexican_, a paper published in Santa Fé: The buffalo slaughter, which has been going on the past few years on the plains, and which increases every year, is wantonly wicked, and should be stopped by the most stringent enactments and most vigilant enforcements of the law. Killing these noble animals for their hides simply, or to gratify the pleasure of some Russian duke or English lord, is a species of vandalism which can not too quickly be checked. United States surveying parties report that there are two thousand hunters on the plains killing these animals for their hides. One party of sixteen hunters report having killed twenty-eight thousand buffaloes during the past summer. It seems to us there is quite as much reason why the Government should protect the buffaloes as the Indians. Mr. McCormick considered the subject important, and had not a doubt of the fearful slaughter. He read the following extract from a letter that he had received from General Hazen: I know a man who killed with his own hand ninety-nine buffaloes in one day, without taking a pound of the meat. The buffalo for food has an intrinsic value about equal to an average Texas beef, or say $20. There are probably not less than a million of these animals on the western plains. If the Government owned a herd of a million oxen they would at least take steps to prevent this wanton slaughter. The railroads have made the buffalo so accessible as to present a case not dissimilar. He agreed with Mr. Cox that some features of the bill would probably be impracticable, and moved to amend it. He did not believe any bill would entirely accomplish the purpose, but he desired that such wanton slaughter should be stopped. Said he, \"It would have been well both for the Indians and the white men if an enactment of this kind had been placed on our statute-books years ago. * * * I know of no one act that would gratify the red men more.\" Mr. Holman expressed surprise that Mr. Cox should make any objection to parts of the measure. The former regarded the bill as \"an effort in a most commendable direction,\" and trusted that it would pass. Mr. Cox said he would not have objected to the bill but from the fact that it was partial in its provisions. He wanted a bill that would impose a penalty on every man, red, white, or black, who may wantonly kill these buffaloes. Mr. Potter desired to know whether more buffaloes were slaughtered by the Indians than by white men. Mr. Fort thought the white men were doing the greatest amount of killing. Mr. Eldridge thought there would be just as much propriety in killing the fish in our rivers as in destroying the buffalo in order to compel the Indians to become civilized. Mr. Conger said: \"As a matter of fact, every man knows the range of the buffalo has grown more and more confined year after year; that they have been driven westward before advancing civilization.\" But he opposed the bill! Mr. Hawley, of Connecticut, said: \"I am glad to see this bill. I am in favor of this law, and hope it will pass.\" Mr. Lowe favored the bill, and thought that the buffalo ought to be protected for proper utility. Mr. Cobb thought they ought to be protected for the settlers, who depended partly on them for food. Mr. Parker, of Missouri, intimated that the policy of the Secretary of the Interior was a sound one, and that the buffaloes ought to be exterminated, to prevent difficulties in civilizing the Indians. Said Mr. Conger, \"I do not think the measure will tend at all to protect the buffalo.\" Mr. McCormick replied: \"This bill will not prevent the killing of buffaloes for any useful purpose, but only their wanton destruction.\" Mr. Kasson said: \"I wish to say one word in support of this bill, because I have had some experience as to the manner in which these buffaloes are treated by hunters. The buffalo is a creature of vast utility, * * *. This animal ought to be protected; * * *.\" The question being taken on the passage of the bill, there were--ayes 132, noes not counted. So the bill was passed. On June 23, 1874, this bill (H. R. 921) came up in the Senate.[74] [Note 74: Congressional Globe, Vol. 2, part 6, Forty-third Congress, first session.] Mr. Harvey moved, as an amendment, to strike out the words \"who is not an Indian.\" Said Mr. Hitchcock, \"That will defeat the bill.\" Mr. Frelinghuysen said: \"That would prevent the Indians from killing the buffalo on their own ground. I object to the bill.\" Mr. Sargent said: \"I think we can pass the bill in the right shape without objection. Let us take it up. It is a very important one.\" Mr. Frelinghuysen withdrew his objection. Mr. Harvey thought it was a very important bill, and withdrew his amendment. The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered to a third reading, read the third time, and passed. It went to President Grant for signature, and expired in his hands at the adjournment of that session of Congress. On February 2, 1874, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R. 1689) to tax buffalo hides; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. On June 10, 1874, Mr. Dawes, from the Committee on Ways and Means, reported back the bill adversely, and moved that it be laid on the table. Mr. Fort asked to have the bill referred to the Committee of the Whole, and it was so referred. On February 2, 1874, Mr. R. C. McCormick, of Arizona, introduced in the House a bill (H. R. 1728) restricting the killing of the bison, or buffalo, on the public lands; which was referred to the Committee on the Public Lands, and never heard of more. On January 31, 1876, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R. 1719) to prevent the useless slaughter of buffaloes within the Territories of the United States, which was referred to the Committee on the Territories.[75] [Note 75: Forty-fourth Congress, first session, vol. 4, part 2, pp. 1237-1241.] The Committee on the Territories reported back the bill without amendment on February 23, 1876.[76] Its provisions were in every respect identical with those of the bill introduced by Mr. Fort in 1874, and which passed both houses. [Note 76: Forty-fourth Congress first session, vol. 4, part 1, p. 773.] In support of it Mr. Fort said: \"The intention and object of this bill is to preserve them [the buffaloes] for the use of the Indians, whose homes are upon the public domain, and to the frontiersmen, who may properly use them for food. * * * They have been and are now being slaughtered in large numbers. * * * Thousands of these noble brutes are annually slaughtered out of mere wontonness. * * * This bill, just as it is now presented, passed the last Congress. It was not vetoed, but fell, as I understand, merely for want of time to consider it after having passed both houses.\" He also intimated that the Government was using a great deal of money for cattle to furnish the Indians, while the buffalo was being wantonly destroyed, whereas they might be turned to their good. Mr. Crounse wanted the words \"who is not an Indian\" struck out, so as to make the bill general. He thought Indians were to blame for the wanton destruction. Mr. Fort thought the amendment unnecessary, and stated that he was informed that the Indians did not destroy the buffaloes wantonly. Mr. Dunnell thought the bill one of great importance. The Clerk read for him a letter from A. G. Brackett, lieutenant-colonel, Second United States Cavalry, stationed at Omaha Barracks, in which was a very urgent request to have Congress interfere to prevent the wholesale slaughter then going on. Mr. Reagan thought the bill proper and right. He knew from personal experience how the wanton slaughtering was going on, and also that the Indians were _not_ the ones who did it. Mr. Townsend, of New York, saw no reason why a white man should not be allowed to kill a female buffalo as well as an Indian. He said it would be impracticable to have a separate law for each. Mr. Maginnis did not agree with him. He thought the bill ought to pass as it stood. Mr. Throckmorton thought that while the intention of the bill was a good one, yet it was mischievous and difficult to enforce, and would also work hardship to a large portion of our frontier people. He had several objections. He also thought a cow buffalo could not be distinguished at a distance. Mr. Hancock, of Texas, thought the bill an impolicy, and that the sooner the buffalo was exterminated the better. Mr. Fort replied by asking him why all the game--deer, antelope, etc.--was not slaughtered also. Then he went on to state that to exterminate the buffalo would be to starve innocent children of the red man, and to make the latter more wild and savage than he was already. Mr. Baker, of Indiana, offered the following amendment as a substitute for the one already offered: _Provided_, That any white person who shall employ, hire, or procure, directly or indirectly, any Indian to kill any buffalo forbidden to be killed by this act, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and punished in the manner provided in this act. Mr. Fort stated that a certain clause in his bill covered the object of the amendment. Mr. Jenks offered the following amendment: Strike out in the fourth line of the second section the word \"can\" and insert \"shall;\" and in the second line of the same section insert the word \"wantonly\" before \"kill;\" so that the clause will read: \"That it shall be in like manner unlawful for any such person to wantonly kill, wound, or destroy in the said Territories any greater number of male buffaloes than are needed for food by such person, or than shall be used, cured, or preserved for the food of other persons, or for the market.\" Mr. Conger said: \"I think the whole bill is unwise. I think it is a useless measure.\" Mr. Hancock said: \"I move that the bill and amendment be laid on the table.\" The motion to lay the bill upon the table was defeated, and the amendment was rejected. Mr. Conger called for a division on the passage of the bill. The House divided, and there were--ayes 93, noes 48. He then demanded tellers, and they reported--ayes 104, noes 36. So the bill was passed. On February 25, 1876, the bill was reported to the Senate, and referred to the Committee on Territories, from whence it never returned. On March 20, 1876, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R. 2767) to tax buffalo hides; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and never heard of afterward. This was the last move made in Congress in behalf of the buffalo. The philanthropic friends of the frontiersman, the Indian, and of the buffalo himself, despaired of accomplishing the worthy object for which they had so earnestly and persistently labored, and finally gave up the fight. At the very time the effort in behalf of buffalo protection was abandoned the northern herd still flourished, and might have been preserved from extirpation. At various times the legislatures of a few of the Western States and Territories enacted laws vaguely and feebly intended to provide some sort of protection to the fast disappearing animals. One of the first was the game law of Colorado, passed in 1872, which declared that the killers of game should not leave any flesh to spoil. The western game laws of those days amounted to about as much as they do now; practically nothing at all. I have never been able to learn of a single instance, save in the Yellowstone Park, wherein a western hunter was prevented by so simple and innocuous a thing as a game law from killing game. Laws were enacted, but they were always left to enforce themselves. The idea of the frontiersman (the average, at least) has always been to kill as much game as possible before some other fellow gets a chance at it, _and before it is all killed off_! So he goes at the game, and as a general thing kills all he can while it lasts, and with it feeds himself and family, his dogs, and even his hogs, to repletion. I knew one Montana man north of Miles City who killed for his own use twenty-six black-tail deer in one season, and had so much more venison than he could consume or give away that a great pile of carcasses lay in his yard until spring and spoiled. During the existence of the buffalo it was declared by many an impossibility to stop or prevent the slaughter. Such an accusation of weakness and imbecility on the part of the General Government is an insult to our strength and resources. The protection of game is now and always has been simply a question of money. A proper code of game laws and a reasonable number of salaried game-wardens, sworn to enforce them and punish all offenses against them, would have afforded the buffalo as much protection as would have been necessary to his continual existence. To be sure, many buffaloes would have been killed on the sly in spite of laws to the contrary, but it was wholesale slaughter that wrought the extermination, and that could easily have been prevented. A tax of 50 cents each on buffalo robes would have maintained a sufficient number of game-wardens to have reasonably regulated the killing, and maintained for an indefinite period a bountiful source of supply of food, and also raiment for both the white man of the plains and the Indian. By judicious management the buffalo could have been made to yield an annual revenue equal to that we now receive from the fur-seals--$100,000 per year. During the two great periods of slaughter--1870-\\'75 and 1880-\\'84--the principal killing grounds were as well known as the stock-yards of Chicago. Had proper laws been enacted, and had either the general or territorial governments entered with determination upon the task of restricting the killing of buffaloes to proper limits, their enforcement would have been, in the main, as simple and easy as the collection of taxes. Of course the solitary hunter in a remote locality would have bowled over his half dozen buffaloes in secure defiance of the law; but such desultory killing could not have made much impression on the great mass for many years. The business-like, wholesale slaughter, wherein one hunter would openly kill five thousand buffaloes and market perhaps two thousand hides, could easily have been stopped forever. Buffalo hides could not have been dealt in clandestinely, for many reasons, and had there been no sale for ill-gotten spoils the still-hunter would have gathered no spoils to sell. It was an undertaking of considerable magnitude, and involving a cash outlay of several hundred dollars to make up an \"outfit\" of wagons, horses, arms and ammunition, food, etc., for a trip to \"the range\" after buffaloes. It was these wholesale hunters, both in the North and the South, who exterminated the species, and to say that all such undertakings could not have been effectually prevented by law is to accuse our law-makers and law-officers of imbecility to a degree hitherto unknown. There is nowhere in this country, nor in any of the waters adjacent to it, a living species of any kind which the United States Government can not fully and perpetually protect from destruction by human agencies if it chooses to do so. The destruction of the buffalo was a loss of wealth perhaps twenty times greater than the sum it would have cost to conserve it, and this stupendous waste of valuable food and other products was committed by one class of the American people and permitted by another with a prodigality and wastefulness which even in the lowest savages would be inexcusable. V. COMPLETENESS OF THE EXTERMINATION. (May 1, 1889.) Although the existence of a few widely-scattered individuals enables us to say that the bison is not yet absolutely extinct in a wild state, there is no reason to hope that a single wild and unprotected individual will remain alive ten years hence. The nearer the species approaches to complete extermination, the more eagerly are the wretched fugitives pursued to the death whenever found. Western hunters are striving for the honor (?) of killing the last buffalo, which, it is to be noted, has already been slain about a score of times by that number of hunters. The buffaloes still alive in a wild state are so very few, and have been so carefully \"marked down\" by hunters, it is possible to make a very close estimate of the total number remaining. In this enumeration the small herd in the Yellowstone National Park is classed with other herds in captivity and under protection, for the reason that, had it not been for the protection afforded by the law and the officers of the Park, not one of these buffaloes would be living to-day. Were the restrictions of the law removed now, every one of those animals would be killed within three months. Their heads alone are worth from $25 to $50 each to taxidermists, and for this reason every buffalo is a prize worth the hunter\\'s winning. Had it not been for stringent laws, and a rigid enforcement of them by Captain Harris, the last of the Park buffaloes would have been shot years ago by Vic. Smith, the Rea Brothers, and other hunters, of whom there is always an able contingent around the Park. In the United States the death of a buffalo is now such an event that it is immediately chronicled by the Associated Press and telegraphed all over the country. By reason of this, and from information already in hand, we are able to arrive at a very fair understanding of the present condition of the species in a wild state. In December, 1886, the Smithsonian expedition left about fifteen buffaloes alive in the bad lands of the Missouri-Yellowstone divide, at the head of Big Porcupine Creek. In 1887 three of these were killed by cowboys, and in 1888 two more, the last death recorded being that of an old bull killed near Billings. There are probably eight or ten stragglers still remaining in that region, hiding in the wildest and most broken tracts of the bad lands, as far as possible from the cattle ranches, and where even cowboys seldom go save on a round-up. From the fact that no other buffaloes, at least so far as can be learned, have been killed in Montana during the last two years, I am convinced that the bunch referred to are the last representatives of the species remaining in Montana. In the spring of 1886 Mr. B. C. Winston, while on a hunting trip about 75 miles west of Grand Rapids, Dakota, saw seven buffaloes--five adult animals and two calves; of which he killed one, a large bull, and caught a calf alive. On September 11, 1888, a solitary bull was killed 3 miles from the town of Oakes, in Dickey County. There are still three individuals in the unsettled country lying between that point and the Missouri, which are undoubtedly the only wild representatives of the race east of the Missouri River. On April 28, 1887, Dr. William Stephenson, of the United States Army, wrote me as follows from Pilot Butte, about 30 miles north of Rock Springs, Wyoming: \"There are undoubtedly buffalo within 50 or 60 miles of here, two having been killed out of a band of eighteen some ten days since by cowboys, and another band of four seen near there. I hear from cattlemen of their being seen every year north and northeast of here.\" This band was seen once in 1888. In February, 1889, Hon. Joseph M. Carey, member of Congress from Wyoming, received a letter informing him that this band of buffaloes, consisting of twenty-six head, had been seen grazing in the Red Desert of Wyoming, and that the Indians were preparing to attack it. At Judge Carey\\'s request the Indian Bureau issued orders which it was hoped would prevent the slaughter. So, until further developments, we have the pleasure of recording the presence of twenty-six wild buffaloes in southern Wyoming. There are no buffaloes whatever in the vicinity of the Yellowstone Park, either in Wyoming, Montana, or Idaho, save what wander out of that reservation, and when any do, they are speedily killed. There is a rumor that there are ten or twelve mountain buffaloes still on foot in Colorado, in a region called Lost Park, and, while it lacks confirmation, we gladly accept it as a fact. In 1888 Mr. C. B. Cory, of Boston, saw in Denver, Colorado, eight fresh buffalo skins, which it was said had come from the region named above. In 1885 there was a herd of about forty \"mountain buffalo\" near South Park, and although some of the number may still survive, the indications are that the total number of wild buffaloes in Colorado does not exceed twenty individuals. In Texas a miserable remnant of the great southern herd still remains in the \"Pan-handle country,\" between the two forks of the Canadian River. In 1886 about two hundred head survived, which number by the summer of 1887 had been reduced to one hundred, or less. In the hunting season of 1887-\\'88 a ranchman named Lee Howard fitted out and led a strong party into the haunts of the survivors, and killed fifty-two of them. In May, 1888, Mr. C. J. Jones again visited this region for the purpose of capturing buffaloes alive. His party found, from first to last, thirty-seven buffaloes, of which they captured eighteen head, eleven adult cows and seven calves; the greatest feat ever accomplished in buffalo-hunting. It is highly probable that Mr. Jones and his men saw about all the buffaloes now living in the Pan-handle country, and it therefore seems quite certain that not over twenty-five individuals remain. These are so few, so remote, and so difficult to reach, it is to be hoped no one will consider them worth going after, and that they will be left to take care of themselves. It is greatly to be regretted that the State of Texas does not feel disposed to make a special effort for their protection and preservation. In regard to the existence of wild buffaloes in the British Possessions, the statements of different authorities are at variance, by far the larger number holding the opinion that there are in all the Northwest Territory only a few almost solitary stragglers. But there is still good reason for the hope, and also the belief, that there still remain in Athabasca, between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers, at least a few hundred \"wood buffalo.\" In a very interesting and well-considered article in the London _Field_ of November 10, 1888, Mr. Miller Christy quotes all the available positive evidence bearing on this point, and I gladly avail myself of the opportunity to reproduce it here: \"The Hon. Dr. Schulz, in the recent debate on the Mackenzie River basin, in the Canadian senate, quoted Senator Hardisty, of Edmonton, of the Hudson\\'s Bay Company, to the effect that the wood buffalo still existed in the region in question. \\'It was,\\' he said, \\'difficult to estimate how many; but probably five or six hundred still remain in scattered bands.\\' There had been no appreciable difference in their numbers, he thought, during the last fifteen years, as they could not be hunted on horseback, on account of the wooded character of the country, and were, therefore, very little molested. They are larger than the buffalo of the great plains, weighing at least 150 pounds more. They are also coarser haired and straighter horned. \"The doctor also quoted Mr. Frank Oliver, of Edmonton, to the effect that the wood buffalo still exists in small numbers between the Lower Peace and Great Slave Rivers, extending westward from the latter to the Salt River in latitude 60 degrees, and also between the Peace and Athabasca Rivers. He states that \\'they are larger than the prairie buffalo, and the fur is darker, but practically they are the same animal.\\' ...Some buffalo meat is brought in every winter to the Hudson\\'s Bay Company\\'s posts nearest the buffalo ranges. \"Dr. Schulz further stated that he had received the following testimony from Mr. Donald Ross, of Edmonton: The wood buffalo still exists in the localities named. About 1870 one was killed as far west on Peace River as Port Dunvegan. They are quite different from the prairie buffalo, being nearly double the size, as they will dress fully 700 pounds.\" It will be apparent to most observers, I think, that Mr. Ross\\'s statement in regard to the size of the wood buffalo is a random shot. In a private letter to the writer, under date of October 22, 1887, Mr. Harrison S. Young, of the Hudson\\'s Bay Company\\'s post at Edmonton, writes as follows: \"The buffalo are not yet extinct in the Northwest. There are still some stray ones on the prairies away to the south of this, but they must be very few. I am unable to find any one who has personal knowledge of the killing of one during the last two years, though I have since the receipt of your letter questioned a good many half-breeds on the subject. In our district of Athabasca, along the Salt River, there are still a few wood buffalo killed every year, but they are fast diminishing in numbers and are also becoming very shy.\" In his \"Manitoba and the Great Northwest\" Prof. John Macoun has this to say regarding the presence of the wood buffalo in the region referred to: \"The wood buffalo, when I was on the Peace River in 1875, were confined to the country lying between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers north of latitude 57° 30\\', or chiefly in the Birch Hills. They were also said to be in some abundance on the Salt and Hay Rivers, running into the Save River north of Peace River. The herds thirteen years ago [now nineteen] were supposed to number about one thousand, all told. I believe many still exist, as the Indians of that region eat fish, which are much easier procured than either buffalo or moose, and the country is much too difficult for white men.\" All this evidence, when carefully considered, resolves itself into simply this and no more: The only evidence in favor of the existence of any live buffaloes between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers is in the form of very old rumors, most of them nearly fifteen years old; time enough for the Indians to have procured fire-arms in abundance and killed all those buffaloes two or three times over. Mr. Miller Christy takes \"the mean of the estimates,\" and assumes that there are now about five hundred and fifty buffaloes in the region named. If we are to believe in the existence there of any stragglers his estimate is a fair one, and we will gladly accept it. The total is therefore as follows: +-------------------------------------------------+ | _Number of American bison running wild | | and unprotected on January 1, 1889._ | +-------------------------------------------------+ |In the Pan-handle of Texas | 25| |In Colorado | 20| |In southern Wyoming | 26| |In the Musselshell country, Montana | 10| |In western Dakota | 4| | |---| | Total number in the United States | 85| |In Athabasca, Northwest Territory (estimated)|550| | |---| | Total in all North America |635| +-------------------------------------------------+ Add to the above the total number already recorded in captivity (256) and those under Government protection in the Yellowstone Park (200), and the whole number of individuals of _Bison americanus_ now living is 1,091. From this time it is probable that many rumors of the sudden appearance of herds of buffaloes will become current. Already there have been three or four that almost deserve special mention. The first appeared in March, 1887, when various Western newspapers published a circumstantial account of how a herd of about three hundred buffaloes swam the Missouri River about 10 miles above Bismarck, near the town of Painted Woods, and ran on in a southwesterly direction. A letter of inquiry, addressed to Mr. S. A. Peterson, postmaster at Painted Woods, elicited the following reply: \"The whole rumor is false, and without any foundation. I saw it first in the ---- newspaper, where I believe it originated.\" In these days of railroads and numberless hunting parties, there is not the remotest possibility of there being anywhere in the United States a herd of a hundred, or even fifty, buffaloes which has escaped observation. Of the eighty-five head still existing in a wild state it may safely be predicted that not even one will remain alive five years hence. A buffalo is now so great a prize, and by the ignorant it is considered so great an honor(!) to kill one, that extraordinary exertions will be made to find and shoot down without mercy the \"last buffalo.\" There is no possible chance for the race to be perpetuated in a wild state, and in a few years more hardly a bone will remain above ground to mark the existence of the must prolific mammalian species that ever existed, so far as we know. VI. EFFECTS OF THE EXTERMINATION. The buffalo supplied the Indian with food, clothing, shelter, bedding, saddles, ropes, shields, and innumerable smaller articles of use and ornament In the United States a paternal government takes the place of the buffalo in supplying all these wants of the red man, and it costs several millions of dollars annually to accomplish the task. The following are the tribes which depended very largely--some almost wholly--upon the buffalo for the necessities, and many of the luxuries, of their savage life until the Government began to support them: +------------------------------------+ |Sioux |30,561| |Crow | 3,226| |Piegan, Blood, and Blackfeet | 2,026| |Cheyenne | 3,477| |Gros Ventres | 856| |Arickaree | 517| |Mandan | 283| |Bannack and Shoshone | 2,001| |Nez Percé | 1,460| |Assinniboine | 1,688| |Kiowas and Comanches | 2,756| |Arapahoes | 1,217| |Apache | 332| |Ute | 978| |Omaha | 1,160| |Pawnee | 998| |Winnebago | 1,222| | |------| | Total |54,758| +------------------------------------+ This enumeration (from the census of 1886) leaves entirely out of consideration many thousands of Indians living in the Indian Territory and other portions of the Southwest, who drew an annual supply of meat and robes from the chase of the buffalo, notwithstanding the fact that their chief dependence was upon agriculture. The Indians of what was once the buffalo country are not starving and freezing, for the reason that the United States Government supplies them regularly with beef and blankets in lieu of buffalo. Does any one imagine that the Government could not have regulated the killing of buffaloes, and thus maintained the supply, for far less money than it now costs to feed and clothe those 54,758 Indians! How is it with the Indians of the British Possessions to-day? Prof. John Maconn writes as follows in his \"Manitoba and the Great Northwest,\" page 342: \"During the last three years [prior to 1883] the great herds have been kept south of our boundary, and, as the result of this, our Indians have been on the verge of starvation. When the hills were covered with countless thousands [of buffaloes] in 1877, the Blackfeet were dying of starvation in 1879.\" During the winter of 1886-\\'87, destitution and actual starvation prevailed to an alarming extent among certain tribes of Indians in the Northwest Territory who once lived bountifully on the buffalo. A terrible tale of suffering in the Athabasca and Peace River country has recently (1888) come to the minister of the interior of the Canadian government, in the form of a petition signed by the bishop of that diocese, six clergymen and missionaries, and several justices of the peace. It sets forth that \"owing to the destruction of game, the Indians, both last winter and last summer, have been in a state of starvation. They are now in a complete state of destitution, and are utterly unable to provide themselves with clothing, shelter, ammunition, or food for the coming winter.\" The petition declares that on account of starvation, and consequent cannibalism, a party of twenty-nine Cree Indians was reduced to three in the winter of 1886.[77] Of the Fort Chippewyan Indians, between twenty and thirty starved to death last winter, and the death of many more was hastened by want of food and by famine diseases. Many other Indians--Crees, Beavers, and Chippewyans--at almost all points where there are missions or trading posts, would certainly have starved to death but for the help given them by the traders and missionaries at those places. It is now declared by the signers of the memorial that scores of families, having lost their heads by starvation, are now perfectly helpless, and during the coming winter must either starve to death or eat one another unless help comes. Heart-rending stories of suffering and cannibalism continue to come in from what was once the buffalo plains. [Note 77: It was the Cree Indians who used to practice impounding buffaloes, slaughtering a penful of two hundred head at a time with most fiendish glee, and leaving all but the very choicest of the meat to putrefy.] If ever thoughtless people were punished for their reckless improvidence, the Indians and half-breeds of the Northwest Territory are now paying the penalty for the wasteful slaughter of the buffalo a few short years ago. The buffalo is his own avenger, to an extent his remorseless slayers little dreamed he ever could be. VII. PRESERVATION OF THE SPECIES FROM ABSOLUTE EXTINCTION. There is reason to fear that unless the United States Government takes the matter in hand and makes a special effort to prevent it, the pure-blood bison will be lost irretrievably through mixture with domestic breeds and through in-and-in breeding. The fate of the Yellowstone Park herd is, to say the least, highly uncertain. A distinguished Senator, who is deeply interested in legislation for the protection of the National Park reservation, has declared that the pressure from railway corporations, which are seeking a foot-hold in the park, has become so great and so aggressive that he fears the park will \"eventually be broken up.\" In any such event, the destruction of the herd of park buffaloes would be one of the very first results. If the park is properly maintained, however, it is to be hoped that the buffaloes now in it will remain there and increase indefinitely. As yet there are only two captive buffaloes in the possession of the Government, viz, those in the Department of Living Animals of the National Museum, presented by Hon. E. G. Blackford, of New York. The buffaloes now in the Zoological Gardens of the country are but few in number, and unless special pains be taken to prevent it, by means of judicious exchanges, from time to time, these will rapidly deteriorate in size, and within a comparatively short time run out entirely, through continued in-and-in breeding. It is said that even the wild aurochs in the forests of Lithuania are decreasing in size and, in number from this cause. With private owners of captive buffaloes, the temptations to produce cross-breeds will be so great that it is more than likely the breeding of pure-blood buffaloes will be neglected. Indeed, unless some stockman like Mr. C. J. Jones takes particular pains to protect his full blood buffaloes, and keep the breed absolutely pure, in twenty years there will not be a pure-blood animal of that species on any stock farm in this country. Under existing conditions, the constant tendency of the numerous domestic forms is to absorb and utterly obliterate the few wild ones. If we may judge from the examples set as by European governments, it is clearly the duty of our Government to act in this matter, and act promptly, with a degree of liberality and promptness which can not be otherwise than highly gratifying to every American citizen and every friend of science throughout the world. The Fiftieth Congress, at its last session, responded to the call made upon it, and voted $200,000 for the establishment of a National Zoological Park in the District of Columbia on a grand scale. One of the leading purposes it is destined to serve is the preservation and breeding in comfortable, and so far as space is concerned, luxurious captivity of a number of fine specimens of every species of American quadruped now threatened with extermination.[78] [Note 78: It is indeed an unbounded satisfaction to be able to now record the fact that this important task, in which every American citizen has a personal interest, is actually to be undertaken. Last year we could only way it ought to be undertaken. In its accomplishment, the Government expects the co-operation of private individuals all over the country in the form of gifts of desirable living animals, for no government could afford to purchase all the animals necessary for a great Zoological Garden, provide for their wants in a liberal way, and yet give the public free access to the collection, as is to be given to the National Zoological Park.] At least eight or ten buffaloes of pure breed should be secured very soon by the Zoological Park Commission, by gift if possible, and cared for with special reference to keeping the breed absolutely pure, and _keeping the herd from deteriorating and dying out through in-and-in breeding_. The total expense would be trifling in comparison with the importance of the end to be gained, and in that way we might, in a small measure, atone for our neglect of the means which would have protected the great herds from extinction. In this way, by proper management, it will be not only possible but easy to preserve fine living representatives of this important species for centuries to come. The result of continuing in-breeding is certain extinction. Its progress may be so slow as to make no impression upon the mind of a herd-owner, but the end is only a question of time. The fate of a majority of the herds of British wild cattle (_Bos urus_) warn us what to expect with the American bison under similar circumstances. Of the fourteen herds of wild cattle which were in existence in England and Scotland during the early part of the present century, direct descendants of the wild herds found in Great Britain, nine have become totally extinct through in breeding. The five herds remaining are those at Somerford Park, Blickling Hall, Woodbastwick, Chartley, and Chillingham. PART III.--THE SMITHSONIAN EXPEDITION FOR MUSEUM SPECIMENS. I. THE EXPLORATION. During the first three months of the year 1886 it was ascertained by the writer, then chief taxidermist of the National Museum, that the extermination of the American bison had made most alarming progress. By extensive correspondence it was learned that the destruction of all the large herds, both North and South, was already an accomplished fact. While it was generally supposed that at least a few thousand individuals still inhabited the more remote and inaccessible regions of what once constituted the great northern buffalo range, it was found that the actual number remaining in the whole United States was probably less than three hundred. By some authorities who were consulted it was considered an impossibility to procure a large series of specimens anywhere in this country, while others asserted positively that there were no wild buffaloes south of the British possessions save those in the Yellowstone National Park. Canadian authorities asserted with equal positiveness that none remained in their territory. A careful inventory of the specimens in the collection of the National Museum revealed the fact that, with the exception of one mounted female skin, another unmounted, and one mounted skeleton of a male buffalo, the Museum was actually without presentable specimens of this most important and interesting mammal. Besides those mentioned above, the collection contained only two old, badly mounted, and dilapidated skins, (one of which had been taken in summer, and therefore was not representative), an incomplete skeleton, some fragmentary skulls of no value, and two mounted heads. Thus it appeared that the Museum was unable to show a series of specimens, good or bad, or even one presentable male of good size. In view of this alarming state of affairs, coupled with the already declared extinction of _Bison americanus_, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Prof. Spencer F. Baird, determined to send a party into the field at once to find wild buffalo, if any were still living, and in case any were found to collect a number of specimens. Since it seemed highly uncertain whether any other institution, or any private individual, would have the opportunity to collect a large supply of specimens before it became too late, it was decided by the Secretary that the Smithsonian Institution should undertake the task of providing for the future as liberally as possible. For the benefit of the smaller scientific museums of the country, and for others which will come into existence during the next half century, it was resolved to collect at all hazards, in case buffalo could be found, between eighty and one hundred specimens of various kinds, of which from twenty to thirty should be skins, an equal number should be complete skeletons, and of skulls at least fifty. In view of the great scarcity of buffalo and the general belief that it might be a work of some months to find any specimens, even if it were possible to find any at all, it was determined not to risk the success of the undertaking by delaying it until the regular autumn hunting season, but to send a party into the field at once to prosecute a search. It was resolved to discover at all hazards the whereabouts of any buffalo that might still remain in this country in a wild state, and, if possible, to reach them before the shedding of their winter pelage. It very soon became apparent, however, that the latter would prove an utter impossibility. Late in the month of April a letter was received from Dr. J. C. Merrill, United States Army, dated at Huntley, Montana, giving information of reports that buffalo were still to be found in three localities in the Northwest, viz: on the headwaters of the Powder River, Wyoming; in Judith Basin, Montana; and on Big Dry Creek, also in Montana. The reports in regard to the first two localities proved to be erroneous. It was ascertained to a reasonable certainty that there still existed in southwestern Dakota a small band of six or eight wild buffaloes, while from the Pan-handle of Texas there came reports of the existence there, in small scattered hands, of about two hundred head. The buffalo known to be in Dakota were far too few in number to justify a long and expensive search, while those in Texas, on the Canadian River, were too difficult to reach to make it advisable to hunt them save as a last resort. It was therefore decided to investigate the localities named in the Northwest. Through the courtesy of the Secretary of War, an order was sent to the officer commanding the Department of Dakota, requesting him to furnish the party, through the officers in command at Forts Keogh, Maginnis, and McKinney, such field transportation, escort, and camp equipage as might be necessary, and also to sell to the party such commissary stores as might be required, at cost price, plus 10 per cent. The Secretary of the Interior also favored the party with an order, directing all Indian agents, scouts, and others in the service of the Department to render assistance as far as possible when called upon. In view of the public interest attaching to the results of the expedition, the railway transportation of the party to and from Montana was furnished entirely without cost to the Smithsonian Institution. For these valuable courtesies we gratefully acknowledge our obligations to Mr. Frank Thomson, of the Pennsylvania Railroad; Mr. Roswell Miller, of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul; and Mr. Robert Harris, of the Northern Pacific. Under orders from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the writer left Washington on May 6, accompanied by A. H. Forney, assistant in the department of taxidermy, and George H. Hedley, of Medina, New York. It had been decided that Miles City, Montana, might properly be taken as the first objective point, and that town was reached on May 9. Diligent inquiry in Miles City and at Fort Keogh, 2 miles distant, revealed the fact that no one knew of the presence of any wild buffalo anywhere in the Northwest, save within the protected limits of the Yellowstone Park. All inquiries elicited the same reply: \"There are no buffalo any more, and you can\\'t get any anywhere.\" Many persons who were considered good authority declared most positively that there was not a live buffalo in the vicinity of Big Dry Creek, nor anywhere between the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers. An army officer from Fort Maginnis testified to the total absence of buffalo in the Judith Basin, and ranchmen from Wyoming asserted that none remained in the Powder River country. Just at this time it was again reported to us, and most opportunely confirmed by Mr. Henry E. Phillips, owner of the =LU=-bar ranch on Little Dry Creek, that there still remained a chance to find a few buffalo in the country lying south of the Big Dry. On the other hand, other persons who seemed to be fully informed regarding that very region and the animal life it contained, assured us that not a single buffalo remained there, and that a search in that direction would prove fruitless. But the balance of evidence, however, seemed to lie in favor of the Big Dry country, and we resolved to hunt through it with all possible dispatch. On the afternoon of May 13 we crossed the Yellowstone and started northwest up the trail which leads along Sunday Creek. Our entire party consisted of the two assistants already mentioned, a non-commissioned officer, Sergeant Garone, and four men from the Fifth Infantry acting as escort; Private Jones, also from the Fifth Infantry, detailed to act as our cook, and a teamster. Our conveyance consisted of a six-mule team, which, like the escort, was ordered out for twenty days only, and provided accordingly. Before leaving Miles City we purchased two saddle-horses for use in hunting, the equipments for which were furnished by the ordnance department at Fort Keogh. During the first two days\\' travel through the bad lands north of the Yellowstone no mammals were seen save prairie-dogs and rabbits. On the third day a few antelope were seen, but none killed. It is to be borne in mind that this entire region is absolutely treeless everywhere save along the margins of the largest streams. Bushes are also entirely absent, with the exception of sage-brush, and even that does not occur to any extent on the divides. On the third day two young buck antelopes were shot at the Red Buttes. One had already commenced to shed his hair, but the other had not quite reached that point. We prepared the skin of the first specimen and the skeleton of the other. This was the only good antelope skin we obtained in the spring, those of all the other specimens taken being quite worthless on account of the looseness of the hair. During the latter part of May, and from that time on until the long winter hair is completely shed, it falls off in handfuls at the slightest pressure, leaving the skin clad only with a thin growth of new, mouse-colored hair an eighth of an inch long. After reaching Little Dry Creek and hunting through the country on the west side of it nearly to its confluence with the Big Dry we turned southwest, and finally went into permanent camp on Phillips Creek, 8 miles above the =LU=-bar ranch and 4 miles from the Little Dry. At that point we were about 80 miles from Miles City. From information furnished us by Mr. Phillips and the cowboys in his employ, we were assured that about thirty-five head of buffalo ranged in the bad lands between Phillips Creek and the Musselshell River and south of the Big Dry. This tract of country was about 40 miles long from east to west by 25 miles wide, and therefore of about 1,000 square miles in area. Excepting two temporary cowboy camps it was totally uninhabited by man, treeless, without any running streams, save in winter and spring, and was mostly very hilly and broken. In this desolate and inhospitable country the thirty-five buffaloes alluded to had been seen, first on Sand Creek, then at the head of the Big Porcupine, again near the Musselshell, and latest near the head of the Little Dry. As these points were all from 15 to 30 miles distant from each other, the difficulty of finding such a small herd becomes apparent. Although Phillips Creek was really the eastern boundary of the buffalo country, it was impossible for a six-mule wagon to proceed beyond it, at least at that point. Having established a permanent camp, the Government wagon and its escort returned to Fort Keogh, and we proceeded to hunt through the country between Sand Creek and the Little Dry. The absence of nearly all the cowboys on the spring round-up, which began May 20, threatened to be a serious drawback to us, as we greatly needed the services of a man who was acquainted with the country. We had with us as a scout and guide a Cheyenne Indian, named Dog, but it soon became apparent that he knew no more about the country than we did. Fortunately, however, we succeeded in occasionally securing the services of a cowboy, which was of great advantage to us. It was our custom to ride over the country daily, each day making a circuit through a new locality, and covering as much ground as it was possible to ride over in a day. It was also our custom to take trips of from two to four days in length, during which we carried our blankets and rations upon our horses and camped wherever night overtook us, provided water could be found. Our first success consisted in the capture of a buffalo calf, which from excessive running had become unable to keep up with its mother, and had been left behind. The calf was caught alive without any difficulty, and while two of the members of our party carried it to camp across a horse, the other two made a vigorous effort to discover the band of adult animals. The effort was unsuccessful, for, besides the calf, no other buffaloes were seen. Ten days after the above event two bull buffaloes were met with on the Little Dry, 15 miles above the =LU=-bar ranch, one of which was overtaken and killed, but the other got safely away. The shedding of the winter coat was in full progress. On the head, neck, and shoulders the old hair had been entirely replaced by the new, although the two coats were so matted together that the old hair clung in tangled masses to the other. The old hair was brown and weather-beaten, but the new, which was from 3 to 6 inches long, had a peculiar bluish-gray appearance. On the head the new hair was quite black, and contrasted oddly with the lighter color. On the body and hind quarters there were large patches of skin which were perfectly bare, between which lay large patches of old, woolly, brown hair. This curious condition gave the animal a very unkempt and \"seedy\" appearance, the effect of which was heightened by the long, shaggy locks of old, weather beaten hair which clung to the new coat of the neck and shoulders like tattered signals of distress, ready to be blown away by the first gust of wind. This specimen was a large one, measuring 5 feet 4 inches in height. Inasmuch as the skin was not in condition to mount, we took only the skeleton, entire, and the skin of the head and neck. The capture of the calf and the death of this bull proved conclusively that there were buffaloes in that region, and also that they were breeding in comparative security. The extent of the country they had to range over made it reasonably certain that their number would not be diminished to any serious extent by the cowboys on the spring round-up, although it was absolutely certain that in a few months the members of that band would all be killed. The report of the existence of a herd of thirty-five head was confirmed later by cowboys, who had actually seen the animals, and killed two of them merely for sport, as usual. They saved a few pounds of hump meat, and all the rest became food for the wolves and foxes. It was therefore resolved to leave the buffaloes entirely unmolested until autumn, and then, when the robes would be in the finest condition, return for a hunt on a liberal scale. Accordingly, it was decided to return to Washington without delay, and a courier was dispatched with a request for transportation to carry our party back to Fort Keogh. While awaiting the arrival of the wagons, a cowboy in the employ of the Phillips Land and Cattle Company killed a solitary bull buffalo about 15 miles west of our camp, near Sand Creek. This animal had completely shed the hair on his body and hind quarters. In addition to the preservation of his entire skeleton, we prepared the skin also, as an example of the condition of the buffalo immediately after shedding. On June 6 the teams from Fort Keogh arrived, and we immediately returned to Miles City, taking with us our live buffalo calf, two fresh buffalo skeletons, three bleached skeletons, seven skulls, one skin entire, and one head skin, in addition to a miscellaneous collection of skins and skeletons of smaller mammals and birds. On reaching Miles City we hastily packed and shipped our collection, and, taking the calf with us, returned at once to Washington. II. THE HUNT. On September 24 I arrived at Miles City a second time, fully equipped for a protracted hunt for buffalo; this time accompanied only by W. Harvey Brown, a student of the University of Kansas, as field assistant, having previously engaged three cowboys as guides and hunters--Irwin Boyd, James McNaney, and L. S. Russell. Messrs. Boyd and Russell were in Miles City awaiting my arrival, and Mr. McNaney joined us in the field a few days later. Mr. Boyd acted as my foreman during the entire hunt, a position which he filled to my entire satisfaction. Thanks to the energy and good-will of the officers at Fort Keogh, of which Lieutenant-Colonel Cochran was then in command, our transportation, camp equipage, and stores were furnished without an hour\\'s delay. We purchased two months\\' supplies of commissary stores, a team, and two saddle-horses, and hired three more horses, a light wagon, and a set of double harness. Each of the cowboys furnished one horse; so that in our outfit we had ten head, a team, and two good saddle-horses for each hunter. The worst feature of the whole question of subsistence was the absolute necessity of hauling a supply of grain from Miles City into the heart of the buffalo country for our ten horses. For such work as they had to encounter it was necessary to feed them constantly and liberally with oats in order to keep them in condition to do their work. We took with us 2,000 pounds of oats, and by the beginning of November as much more had to be hauled up to us. Thirty six hours after our arrival in Miles City our outfit was complete, and we crossed the Yellowstone and started up the Sunday Creek trail. We had from Fort Keogh a six-mule team, an escort of four men, in charge of Sergeant Bayliss, and an old veteran of more than twenty years\\' service, from the Fifth Infantry, Private Patrick McCanna, who was detailed to act as cook and camp-guard for our party during our stay in the field. On September 29 we reached Tow\\'s ranch, the =HV=, on Big Dry Creek (erroneously called Big Timber Creek on most maps of Montana), at the mouth of Sand Creek, which here flows into it from the southwest. This point is said to be 90 miles from Miles City. Here we received our freight from the six-mule wagon, loaded it with bleached skeletons and skulls of buffalo, and started it back to the post. One member of the escort, Private C. S. West, who was then on two months\\' furlough, elected to join our party for the hunt, and accordingly remained with us to its close. Leaving half of our freight stored at the =HV= ranch, we loaded the remainder upon our own wagon, and started up Sand Creek. [Illustration: SKETCH MAP OF THE HUNT FOR BUFFALO. MONTANA 1886.] At this point the hunt began. As the wagon and extra horses proceeded up the Sand Creek trail in the care of W. Harvey Brown, the three cowboys and I paired off, and while two hunted through the country along the south side of the creek, the others took the north. The whole of the country bordering Sand Creek, quite up to its source, consists of rugged hills and ridges, which sometimes rise to considerable height, cut between by great yawning ravines and hollows, such as persecuted game loves to seek shelter in. Inasmuch as the buffalo we were in search of had been seen hiding in those ravines, it became necessary to search through them with systematic thoroughness; a proceeding which was very wearing upon our horses. Along the south side of Sand Creek, near its source, the divide between it and Little Dry Creek culminates in a chain of high, flat-topped buttes, whose summits bear a scanty growth of stunted pines, which serve to make them conspicuous landmarks. On some maps these insignificant little buttes are shown as mountains, under the name of \"Piny Buttes.\" It was our intention to go to the head of Sand Creek, and beyond, in case buffaloes were not found earlier. Immediately westward of its source there is a lofty level plateau, about 3 miles square, which, by common consent, we called the High Divide. It is the highest ground anywhere between the Big Dry and the Yellowstone, and is the starting point of streams that run northward into the Missouri and Big Dry, eastward into Sand Creek and the Little Dry, southward into Porcupine Creek and the Yellowstone, and westward into the Musselshell. On three sides--north, east, and south--it is surrounded by wild and rugged butte country, and its sides are scored by intricate systems of great yawning ravines and hollows, steep-sided and very deep, and bad lands of the worst description. By the 12th of October the hunt had progressed up Sand Creek to its source, and westward across the High Divide to Calf Creek, where we found a hole of wretchedly bad water and went into permanent camp. We considered that the spot we selected would serve us as a key to the promising country that lay on three sides of it, and our surmise that the buffalo were in the habit of hiding in the heads of those great ravines around the High Divide soon proved to be correct. Our camp at the head of Calf Creek was about 20 miles east of the Musselshell River, 40 miles south of the Missouri, and about 135 miles from Miles City, as the trail ran. Four miles north of us, also on Calf Creek, was the line camp of the =STV= ranch, owned by Messrs. J. H. Conrad & Co., and 18 miles east, near the head of Sand Creek, was the line camp of the =N=-bar ranch, owned by Mr. Newman. At each of these camps there were generally from two to four cowboys. From all these gentlemen we received the utmost courtesy and hospitality on all occasions, and all the information in regard to buffalo which it was in their power to give. On many occasions they rendered us valuable assistance, which is hereby gratefully acknowledged. We saw no buffalo, nor any signs of any, until October 13. On that day, while L. S. Russell was escorting our second load of freight across the High Divide, he discovered a band of seven buffaloes lying in the head of a deep ravine. He fired upon them, but killed none, and when they dashed away he gave chase and followed them 2 or 3 miles. Being mounted on a tired horse, which was unequal to the demands of the chase, he was finally distanced by the herd, which took a straight course and ran due south. As it was then nearly night, nothing further could be done that day except to prepare for a vigorous chase on the morrow. Everything was got in perfect readiness for an early start, and by daybreak the following morning the three cowboys and the writer were mounted on our best horses, and on our way through the bad lands to take up the trail of the seven buffaloes. Shortly after sunrise we found the trail, not far from the head of Calf Creek, and followed it due south. We left the rugged butte region behind us, and entered a tract of country quite unlike anything we had found before. It was composed of a succession of rolling hills and deep hollows, smooth enough on the surface, to all appearances, but like a desert of sand-hills to traverse. The dry soil was loose and crumbly, like loose ashes or scoriæ, and the hoofs of our horses sank into it half-way to the fetlocks at every step. But there was another feature which was still worse. The whole surface of the ground was cracked and seamed with a perfect net-work of great cracks, into which our horses stepped every yard or so, and sank down still farther, with many a tiresome wrench of the joints. It was terrible ground to go over. To make it as bad as possible, a thick growth of sage-brush or else grease-wood was everywhere present for the horses to struggle through, and when it came to dragging a loaded wagon across that 12-mile stretch of \"bad grounds\" or \"gumbo ground,\" as it was called, it was killing work. But in spite of the character of this ground, in one way it was a benefit to us. Owing to its looseness on the surface we were able to track the buffaloes through it with the greatest ease, whereas on any other ground in that country it would have been almost impossible. We followed the trail due south for about 20 miles, which brought us to the head of a small stream called Taylor Creek. Here the bad grounds ended, and in the grassy country which lay beyond, tracking was almost impossible. Just at noon we rode to a high point, and on scanning the hills and hollows with the binocular discovered the buffaloes lying at rest on the level top of a small butte 2 miles away. The original bunch of seven had been joined by an equal number. We crept up to within 200 yards of the buffaloes, which was as close as we could go, fired a volley at them just as they lay, and did not even kill a calf! Instantly they sprang up and dashed away at astonishing speed, heading straight for the sheltering ravines around the High Divide. We had a most exciting and likewise dangerous chase after the herd through a vast prairie-dog town, honey-combed with holes just right for a running horse to thrust a leg in up to the knee and snap it off like a pipe-stem, and across fearfully wide gullies that either had to be leaped or fallen into. McNaney killed a fine old bull and a beautiful two year old, or \"spike\" bull, out of this herd, while I managed to kill a cow and another large old bull, making four for that day, all told. This herd of fourteen head was the largest that we saw during the entire hunt. Two days later, when we were on the spot with the wagon to skin our game and haul in the hides, four more buffaloes were discovered within 2 miles of us, and while I worked on one of the large bull skins to save it from spoiling, the cowboys went after the buffalo, and by a really brilliant exploit killed them all. The first one to fall was an old cow, which was killed at the beginning of the chase, the next was an old bull, who was brought down about 5 miles from the scene of the first attack, then 2 miles farther on a yearling calf was killed. The fourth buffalo, an immense old bull, was chased fully 12 miles before he was finally brought down. The largest bull fell about 8 miles from our temporary camp, in the opposite direction from that in which our permanent camp lay, and at about 3 o\\'clock in the afternoon. There not being time enough in which to skin him completely and reach our rendezvous before dark, Messrs. McNaney and Boyd dressed the carcass to preserve the meat, partly skinned the legs, and came to camp. As early as possible the next morning we drove to the carcass with the wagon, to prepare both skin and skeleton and haul them in. When we reached it we found that during the night a gang of Indians had robbed us of our hard-earned spoil. They had stolen the skin and all the eatable meat, broken up the leg-bones to get at the marrow, and even cut out the tongue. And to injury the skulking thieves had added insult. Through laziness they had left the head unskinned, but on one side of it they had smeared the hair with red war-paint, the other side they had daubed with yellow, and around the base of one horn they had tied a strip of red flannel as a signal of defiance. Of course they had left for parts unknown, and we never saw any signs of them afterward. The gang visited the =LU=-bar ranch a few days later, so we learned subsequently. It was then composed of eleven braves(!), who claimed to be Assinniboines, and were therefore believed to be Piegans, the most notorious horse and cattle thieves in the Northwest. On October 22d Mr. Russell ran down in a fair chase a fine bull buffalo, and killed him in the rough country bordering the High Divide on the south. This was the ninth specimen. On the 26th we made an other trip with the wagon to the Buffalo Buttes, as, for the sake of convenience, we had named the group of buttes near which eight head had already been taken. While Mr. Brown and I were getting the wagon across the bad grounds, Messrs. McNaney and Boyd discovered a solitary bull buffalo feeding in a ravine within a quarter of a mile of our intended camping place, and the former stalked him and killed him at long range. The buffalo had all been attracted to that locality by some springs which lay between two groups of hills, and which was the only water within a radius of about 15 miles. In addition to water, the grass around the Buffalo Buttes was most excellent. During all this time we shot antelope and coyotes whenever an opportunity offered, and preserved the skins and skeletons of the finest until we had obtained a very fine series of both. At this season the pelts of these animals were in the finest possible condition, the hair having attained its maximum length and density, and, being quite new, had lost none of its brightness of color, either by wear or the action of the weather. Along Sand Creek and all around the High Divide antelope were moderately plentiful (but really scarce in comparison with their former abundance), so much so that had we been inclined to slaughter we could have killed a hundred head or more, instead of the twenty that we shot as specimens and for their flesh. We have it to say that from first to last not an antelope was killed which was not made use of to the fullest extent. On the 31st of October, Mr. Boyd and I discovered a buffalo cow and yearling calf in the ravines north of the High Divide, within 3 miles of our camp, and killed them both. The next day Private West arrived with a six mule team from Fort Keogh, in charge of Corporal Clafer and three men. This wagon brought us another 2,000 pounds of oats and various commissary stores. When it started back, on November 3, we sent by it all the skins and skeletons of buffalo, antelope, etc., which we had collected up to that date, which made a heavy load for the six mules. On this same day Mr. McNaney killed two young cow buffaloes in the bad lands south of the High Divide, which brought our total number up to fourteen. On the night of the 3d the weather turned very cold, and on the day following we experienced our first snow-storm. By that time the water in the hole, which up to that time had supplied our camp, became so thick with mud and filth that it was unendurable; and having discovered a fine pool of pure water in the bottom of a little cañon on the southern slope of the High Divide we moved to it forthwith. It was really the upper spring of the main fork of the Big Porcupine, and a finer situation for a camp does not exist in that whole region. The spot which nature made for us was sheltered on all sides by the high walls of the cañon, within easy reach of an inexhaustible supply of good water, and also within reach of a fair supply of dry fire-wood, which we found half a mile below. This became our last permanent camp, and its advantages made up for the barrenness and discomfort of our camp on Calf Creek. Immediately south of us, and 2 miles distant there rose a lofty conical butte about 600 feet high, which forms a very conspicuous landmark from the south. We were told that it was visible from 40 miles down the Porcupine. Strange to say, this valuable landmark was without a name, so far as we could learn; so, for our own convenience, we christened it Smithsonian Butte. The two buffalo cows that Mr. McNaney killed just before we moved our camp seemed to be the last in the country, for during the following week we scouted for 15 miles in three directions, north, east, and south, without finding as much as a hoof-print. At last we decided to go away and give that country absolute quiet for a week, in the hope that some more buffalo would come into it. Leaving McCanna and West to take care of the camp, we loaded a small assortment of general equipage into the wagon and pulled about 25 miles due west to the Musselshell River. We found a fine stream of clear water, flowing over sand and pebbles, with heavy cottonwood timber and thick copses of willow along its banks, which afforded cover for white-tailed deer. In the rugged brakes, which led from the level river bottom into a labyrinth of ravines and gullies, ridges and hog-backs, up to the level of the high plateau above, we found a scanty growth of stunted cedars and pines, which once sheltered great numbers of mule deer, elk, and bear. Now, however, few remain, and these are very hard to find. Even when found, the deer are nearly always young. Although we killed five mule deer and five white-tails, we did not kill even one fine buck, and the only one we saw on the whole trip was a long distance off. We saw fresh tracks of elk, and also grizzly bear, but our most vigorous efforts to discover the animals themselves always ended in disappointment. The many bleaching skulls and antlers of elk and deer, which we found everywhere we went, afforded proof of what that country had been as a home for wild animals only a few years ago. We were not a little surprised at finding the fleshless carcasses of three head of cattle that had been killed and eaten by bears within a few months. In addition to ten deer, we shot three wild geese, seven sharp-tailed grouse, eleven sage grouse, nine Bohemian waxwings, and a magpie, for their skeletons. We made one trip of several miles up the Musselshell, and another due west, almost to the Bull Mountains, but no signs of buffalo were found. The weather at this time was quite cold, the thermometer registering 6 degrees below zero; but, in spite of the fact that we were without shelter and had to bivouac in the open, we were, generally speaking, quite comfortable. Having found no buffalo by the 17th, we felt convinced that we ought to return to our permanent camp, and did so on that day. Having brought back nearly half a wagon-load of specimens in the flesh or half skinned, it was absolutely necessary that I should remain at camp all the next day. While I did so, Messrs. McNaney and Boyd rode over to the Buffalo Buttes, found four fine old buffalo cows, and, after a hard chase, killed them all. Under the circumstances, this was the most brilliant piece of work of the entire hunt. As the four cows dashed past the hunters at the Buffalo Buttes, heading for the High Divide, fully 20 miles distant, McNaney killed one cow, and two others went off wounded. Of course the cowboys gave chase. About 12 miles from the starting-point one of the wounded cows left her companions, was headed off by Boyd, and killed. About 6 miles beyond that one, McNaney overhauled the third cow and killed her, but the fourth one got away for a short time. While McNaney skinned the third cow and dressed the carcass to preserve the meat, Boyd took their now thoroughly exhausted horses to camp and procured fresh mounts. On returning to McNaney they set out in pursuit of the fourth cow, chased her across the High Divide, within a mile or so of our camp, and into the ravines on the northern slope, where she was killed. She met her death nearly if not quite 25 miles from the spot where the first one fell. The death of these four cows brought our number of buffaloes up to eighteen, and made us think about the possibilities of getting thirty. As we were proceeding to the Buffalo Buttes on the day after the \"kill\" to gather in the spoil, Mr. Brown and I taking charge of the wagon, Messrs. McNaney and Boyd went ahead in order to hunt. When within about 5 miles of the Buttes we came unexpectedly upon our companions, down in a hollow, busily engaged in skinning another old cow, which they had discovered traveling across the bad grounds, waylaid, and killed. We camped that night on our old ground at the Buffalo Buttes, and although we all desired to remain a day or two and hunt for more buffalo, the peculiar appearance of the sky in the northwest, and the condition of the atmosphere, warned us that a change of weather was imminent. Accordingly, the following morning we decided without hesitation that it was best to get back to camp that day, and it soon proved very fortunate for us that we so decided. Feeling that by reason of my work on the specimens I had been deprived of a fair share of the chase, I arranged for Mr. Boyd to accompany the wagon on the return trip, that I might hunt through the bad lands west of the Buffalo Buttes, which I felt must contain some buffalo. Mr. Russell went northeast and Mr. McNaney accompanied me. About 4 miles from our late camp we came suddenly upon a fine old solitary bull, feeding in a hollow between two high and precipitous ridges. After a short but sharp chase I succeeded in getting a fair shot at him, and killed him with a ball which broke his left humerus and passed into his lungs. He was the only large bull killed on the entire trip by a single shot. He proved to be a very fine specimen, measuring 5 feet 6 inches in height at the shoulders. The wagon was overtaken and called back to get the skin, and while it was coming I took a complete series of measurements and sketches of him as he lay. Although we removed the skin very quickly, and lost no time in again starting the wagon to our permanent camp, the delay occasioned by the death of our twentieth buffalo,--which occurred on November 20, precisely two months from the date of our leaving Washington to collect twenty buffalo, it possible,--caused us all to be caught in a snow-storm, which burst upon us from the northwest. The wagon had to be abandoned about 12 miles from camp in the bad lands. Mr. Brown packed the bedding on one of the horses and rode the other, he and Boyd reaching camp about 9 o\\'clock that night in a blinding snow-storm. Of coarse the skins in the wagon were treated with preservatives and covered up. It proved to be over a week that the wagon and its load had to remain thus abandoned before it was possible to get to it and bring it to camp, and even then the task was one of great difficulty. In this connection I can not refrain from recording the fact that the services rendered by Mr. W. Harvey Brown on all such trying occasions as the above were invaluable. He displayed the utmost zeal and intelligence, not only in the more agreeable kinds of work and sport incident to the hunt, but also in the disagreeable drudgery, such as team-driving and working on half-frozen specimens in bitter cold weather. The storm which set in on the 20th soon developed into a regular blizzard. A fierce and bitter cold wind swept down from the northwest, driving the snow before it in blinding gusts. Had our camp been poorly sheltered we would have suffered, but at it was we were fairly comfortable. Having thus completed our task (of getting twenty buffaloes), we were anxious to get out of that fearful country before we should get caught in serious difficulties with the weather, and it was arranged that Private C. S. West should ride to Fort Keogh as soon as possible, with a request for transportation. By the third day, November 23, the storm had abated sufficiently that Private West declared his willingness to start. It was a little risky, but as he was to make only 10 miles the first day and stop at the =N=-bar camp on Sand Creek, it was thought safe to let him go. He dressed himself warmly, took my revolver, in order not to be hampered with a rifle, and set out. The next day was clear and fine, and we remarked it as an assurance of Mr. West\\'s safety during his ride from Sand Creek to the =LU=-bar ranch, his second stopping-place. The distance was about 25 miles, through bad lands all the way, and it was the only portion of the route which caused me anxiety for our courier\\'s safety. The snow on the levels was less than 6 inches deep, the most of it having been blown into drifts and hollows; but although the coulées were all filled level to the top, our courier was a man of experience and would know how to avoid them. The 25th day of November was the most severe day of the storm, the mercury in our sheltered cañon sinking to -16 degrees. We had hoped to kill at least five more buffaloes by the time Private West should arrive with the wagons; but when at the end of a week the storm had spent itself, the snow was so deep that hunting was totally impossible save in the vicinity of camp, where there was nothing to kill. We expected the wagons by the 3d of December, but they did not come that day nor within the next three. By the 6th the snow had melted off sufficiently that a buffalo hunt was once more possible, and Mr. McNaney and I decided to make a final trip to the Buffalo Buttes. The state of the ground made it impossible for us to go there and return the same day, so we took a pack-horse and arranged to camp out. When a little over half-way to our old rendezvous we came upon three buffaloes in the bad grounds, one of which was an enormous old bull, the next largest was an adult cow, and the third a two-year-old heifer. Mr. McNaney promptly knocked down the old cow, while I devoted my attention to the bull; but she presently got up and made off unnoticed at the precise moment Mr. McNaney was absorbed in watching my efforts to bring down the old bull. After a short chase my horse carried me alongside my buffalo, and as he turned toward me I gave him a shot through the shoulder, breaking the fore leg and bringing him promptly to the ground. I then turned immediately to pursue the young cow, but by that time she had got on the farther side of a deep gully which was filled with snow, and by the time I got my horse safely across she had distanced me. I then rode back to the old bull. When he saw me coming he got upon his feet and ran a short distance, but was easily overtaken. He then stood at bay, and halting within 30 yards of him I enjoyed the rare opportunity of studying a live bull buffalo of the largest size on foot on his native heath. I even made an outline sketch of him in my note-book. Having studied his form and outlines as much as was really necessary, I gave him a final shot through the lungs, which soon ended his career. This was a truly magnificent specimen in every respect. He was a \"stub-horn\" bull, about eleven years old, much larger every way than any of the others we collected. His height at the shoulder was 5 feet 8 inches perpendicular, or 2 inches more than the next largest of our collection. His hair was in remarkably fine condition, being long, fine, thick, and well colored. The hair in his frontlet is 16 inches in length, and the thick coat of shaggy, straw-colored tufts which covered his neck and shoulders measured 4 inches. His girth behind the fore leg was 8 feet 4 inches, and his weight was estimated at 1,600 pounds. [Illustration: TROPHIES OF THE HUNT. Mounted by the author in the U. S. National Museum. Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the publishers.] I was delighted with our remarkably good fortune in securing such a prize, for, owing to the rapidity with which the large buffaloes are being found and killed off these days, I had not hoped to capture a really old individual. Nearly every adult bull we took carried old bullets in his body, and from this one we took four of various sizes that had been fired into him on various occasions. One was found sticking fast in one of the lumbar vertebræ.[79] [Note 79: This specimen is now the commanding figure of the group of buffalo which has recently been placed on exhibition in the Museum.] After a chase of several miles Mr. McNaney finally overhauled his cow and killed her, which brought the number of buffaloes taken on the fall hunt up to twenty-two. We spent the night at the Buffalo Buttes and returned to camp the next day. Neither on that day nor the one following did the wagons arrive, and on the evening of the 8th we learned from the cowboys of the =N=-bar camp on Sand Creek that our courier, Private West, had not been seen or heard from since he left their camp on November 24, and evidently had got lost and frozen to death in the bad lands. The next day we started out to search for Private West, or news of him, and spent the night with Messrs. Brodhurst and Andrews, at their camp on Sand Creek. On the 10th, Mr. McNaney and I hunted through the bad lands over the course our courier should have taken, while Messrs. Russell and Brodhurst looked through the country around the head of the Little Dry. When McNaney and I reached the =LU=-bar ranch that night we were greatly rejoiced at finding that West was alive, although badly frost-bitten, and in Fort Keogh. It appears that instead of riding due east to the =LU=-bar ranch, he lost his way in the bad lands, where the buttes all look alike when covered with snow, and rode southwest. It is at all times an easy matter for even a cowboy to get lost in Montana if the country is new to him, and when there is snow on the ground the difficulty of finding one\\'s way is increased tenfold. There is not only the danger of losing one\\'s way, but the still greater danger of getting ingulfed in a deep coulée full of loose snow, which may easily cause both horse and rider to perish miserably. Even the most experienced riders sometimes ride into coulées which are level full of snow and hidden from sight. Private West\\'s experience was a terrible one, and also a wonderful case of self-preservation. It shows what a man with a cool head and plenty of grit can go through and live. When he left us he wore two undershirts, a heavy blanket shirt, a soldier\\'s blouse and overcoat, two pairs of drawers, a pair of soldier\\'s woolen trousers, and a pair of overalls. On his feet he wore three pairs of socks, a pair of _low shoes_ with canvas leggins, and he started with his feet tied up in burlaps. His head and hands were also well protected. He carried a 38-caliber revolver, but, by a great oversight, only six matches. When he left the =N=-bar camp, instead of going due east toward the =LU=-bar ranch, he swung around and went southwest, clear around the head of the Little Dry, and finally struck the Porcupine south of our camp. The first night out he made a fire with sage-brush, and kept it going all night. The second night he also had a fire, but it took his last match to make it. During the first three days he had no food, but on the fourth he shot a sage-cock with his revolver, and ate it raw. This effort, however, cost him his last cartridge. Through hard work and lack of food his pony presently gave out, and necessitated long and frequent stops for rest. West\\'s feet threatened to freeze, and he cut off the skirts of his overcoat to wrap them with, in place of the gunny sacking, that had been worn to rags. Being afraid to go to sleep at night, he slept by snatches in the warmest part of the day, while resting his horse. On the 5th day he began to despair of succor, although he still toiled southward through the bad lands toward the Yellowstone, where people lived. On the envelopes which contained my letters he kept a diary of his wanderings, which could tell his story when the cowboys would find his body on the spring round-up. On the afternoon of the sixth day he found a trail and followed it until nearly night, when he came to Cree\\'s sheep ranch, and found the solitary ranchman at home. The warm-hearted frontiersman gave the starving wanderers, man and horse, such a welcome as they stood in need of. West solemnly declares that in twenty-four hours he ate a whole sheep. After two or three days of rest and feeding both horse and rider were able to go on, and in course of time reached Fort Keogh. Without the loss of a single day Colonel Gibson started three teams and an escort up to us, and notwithstanding his terrible experience, West had the pluck to accompany them as guide. His arrival among us once more was like the dead coming to life again. The train reached our camp on the 13th, and on the 15th we pulled out for Miles City, loaded to the wagon-bows with specimens, forage, and camp plunder. From our camp down to the =HV= ranch, at the mouth of Sand Creek, the trail was in a terrible condition. But, thanks to the skill and judgment of the train-master, Mr. Ed. Haskins, and his two drivers, who also knew their business well, we got safely and in good time over the dangerous part of our road. Whenever our own tired and overloaded team got stuck in the mud, or gave out, there was always a pair of mules ready to hitch on and help us out. As a train-master, Mr. Haskins was a perfect model, skillful, pushing, good-tempered, and very obliging. From the =HV= ranch to Miles City the trail was in fine condition, and we went in as rapidly as possible, fearing to be caught in the snow-storm which threatened us all the way in. We reached Miles City on December 20, with our collection complete and in fine condition, and the next day a snow-storm set in which lasted until the 25th, and resulted in over a foot of snow. The ice running in the Yellowstone stopped all the ferry-boats, and it was with good reason that we congratulated ourselves on the successful termination of our hunt at that particular time. Without loss of time Mr. Brown and I packed our collection, which tilled twenty-one large cases, turned in our equipage at Fort Keogh, sold our horses, and started on our homeward journey. In due course of time the collection reached the Museum in good condition, and a series of the best specimens it contains has already been mounted. At this point it is proper to acknowledge our great indebtedness to the Secretary of War for the timely co-operation of the War Department, which rendered the expedition possible. Our thanks are due to the officers who were successively in command at Fort Keogh during our work, Col. John D. Wilkins, Col. George M. Gibson, and Lieut. Col. M. A. Cochran, and their various staff officers; particularly Lieut. C. B. Thompson, quartermaster, and Lieut. H. K. Bailey, adjutant. It is due these officers to state that everything we asked for was cheerfully granted with a degree of promptness which contributed very greatly to the success of the hunt, and lightened its labors very materially. I have already acknowledged our indebtedness to the officers of the Pennsylvania; the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul; and Northern Pacific railways for the courtesies so liberally extended in our emergency. I take pleasure in adding that all the officers and employés of the Northern Pacific Railway with whom we had any relations, particularly Mr. C. S. Fee, general passenger and ticket agent, treated our party with the utmost kindness and liberality throughout the trip. We are in like manner indebted to the officers of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway for valuable privileges granted with the utmost cordiality. Our thanks are also due to Dr. J. C. Merrill, and to Mr. Henry R. Phillips, of the Phillips Land and Cattle Company, on Little Dry Creek, for valuable information at a critical moment, and to the latter for hospitality and assistance in various ways, at times when both were keenly appreciated. Counting the specimens taken in the spring, our total catch of buffalo amounted to twenty-five head, and constituted as complete and fine a series as could be wished for. I am inclined to believe that in size and general quality of pelage the adult bull and cow selected and mounted for our Museum group are not to be surpassed, even if they are ever equaled, by others of their kind. The different ages and sexes were thus represented in our collection: 10 old bulls, 1 young bull, 7 old cows, 4 young cows, 2 yearling calves, 1 three-months calf[80]; total, 25 specimens. [Note 80: Caught alive, but died in captivity July 26, 1886, and now in the mounted group.] Our total collection of specimens of _Bison americanus_, including everything taken, contained the following: 24 fresh skins, 1 head skin, 8 fresh skeletons, 8 dry skeletons, 51 dry skulls, 2 foetal young; total, 94 specimens. Our collection as a whole also included a fine series of skins and skeletons of antelope, deer of two species, coyotes, jack rabbits, sage grouse (of which we prepared twenty-four rough skeletons for the Department of Comparative Anatomy), sharp tailed grouse, and specimens of all the other species of birds and small mammals to be found in that region at that season. From this _matériel_ we now have on exhibition besides the group of buffaloes, a family group of antelope, another of coyotes, and another of prairie dogs, all with natural surroundings. III. THE MOUNTED GROUP IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. The result of the Smithsonian expedition for bison which appeals most strongly to the general public is the huge group of six choice specimens of both sexes and all ages, mounted with natural surroundings, and displayed in a superb mahogany case. The dimensions of the group are as follows: Length, 16 feet; width, 12 feet, and height, 10 feet. The subjoined illustration is a very fair representation of the principal one of its four sides, and the following admirable description (by Mr. Harry P. Godwin), from the Washington _Star_ of March 10, 1888, is both graphic and accurate: A SCENE FROM MONTANA--SIX OF MR. HORNADAY\\'S BUFFALOES FORM A PICTURESQUE GROUP--A BIT OF THE WILD WEST REPRODUCED AT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM--SOMETHING NOVEL IN THE WAY OF TAXIDERMY--REAL BUFFALO-GRASS, REAL MONTANA DIRT, AND REAL BUFFALOES. A little bit of Montana--a small square patch from the wildest part of the wild West--has been transferred to the National Museum. It is so little that Montana will never miss it, but enough to enable one who has the faintest glimmer of imagination to see it all for himself--the hummocky prairie, the buffalo-grass, the sage-brush, and the buffalo. It is as though a little group of buffalo that have come to drink at a pool had been suddenly struck motionless by some magic spell, each in a natural attitude, and then the section of prairie, pool, buffalo, and all had been carefully cut out and brought to the National Museum. All this is in a huge glass case, the largest ever made for the Museum. This case and the space about it, at the south end of the south hall, has been inclosed by high screens for many days while the taxidermist and his assistants have been at work. The finishing touches were put on to-day, and the screens will be removed Monday, exposing to view what is regarded as a triumph of the taxidermist\\'s art. The group, with its accessories, has been prepared so as to tell in an attractive way to the general visitor to the Museum the story of the buffalo, but care has been taken at the same time to secure an accuracy of detail that will satisfy the critical scrutiny of the most technical naturalist. THE ACCESSORIES. The pool of water is a typical alkaline water-hole, such as are found on the great northern range of bison, and are resorted to for water by wild animals in the fall when the small streams are dry. The pool is in a depression in the dry bed of a coulée or small creek. A little mound that rises beside the creek has been partially washed away by the water, leaving a crumbling bank, which shows the strata of the earth, a very thin layer of vegetable soil, beneath a stratum of grayish earth, and a layer of gravel, from which protrude a fossil bone or two. The whole bank shows the marks of erosion by water. Near by the pool a small section of the bank has fallen. A buffalo trail passes by the pool in front. This is a narrow path, well beaten down, depressed, and bare of grass. Such paths were made by herds of bison all over their pasture region as they traveled down water-courses, in single file, searching for water. In the grass some distance from the pool lie the bleaching skulls of two buffalo who have fallen victims to hunters who have cruelly lain in wait to get a shot at the animals as they come to drink. Such relics, strewn all over the plain, tell the story of the extermination of the American bison. About the pool and the sloping mound grow the low buffalo-grass, tufts of tall bunch-grass and sage-brush, and a species of prickly pear. The pool is clear and tranquil. About its edges is a white deposit of alkali. These are the scenic accessories of the buffalo group, but they have an interest almost equal to that of the buffaloes themselves, for they form really and literally a genuine bit of the West. The homesick Montana cowboy, far from his wild haunts, can here gaze upon his native sod again; for the sod, the earth that forms the face of the bank, the sage-brush, and all were brought from Montana--all except the pool. The pool is a glassy delusion, and very perfect in its way. One sees a plant growing beneath the water, and in the soft, oozy bottom, near the edge, are the deep prints made by the fore feet of a big buffalo bull. About the soft, moist earth around the pool, and in the buffalo trail are the foot-tracks of the buffalo that have tramped around the pool, some of those nearest the edge having filled with water. THE SIX BUFFALOES. The group comprises six buffaloes. In front of the pool, as if just going to drink, is the huge buffalo bull, the giant of his race, the last one that was secured by the Smithsonian party in 1888, and the one that is believed to be the largest specimen of which there is authentic record. Near by is a cow eight years old, a creature that would be considered of great dimensions in any other company than that of the big bull. Near the cow is a suckling calf, four months old. Upon the top of the mound is a \"spike\" bull, two and a half years old; descending the mound away from the pool is a young cow three years old, on one side, and on the other a male calf a year and a half old. All the members of the group are disposed in natural attitudes. The young cow is snuffing at a bunch of tall grass; the old bull and cow are turning their heads in the same direction apparently, as if alarmed by something approaching; the others, having slaked their thirst, appear to be moving contentedly away. The four months\\' old calf was captured alive and brought to this city. It lived for some days in the Smithsonian grounds, but pined for its prairie home, and finally died. It is around the great bull that the romance and main interest of the group centers. * * * * * It seemed as if Providence had ordained that this splendid animal, perfect in limb, noble in size, should be saved to serve as a monument to the greatness of his race, that once roamed the prairies in myriads. Bullets found in his body showed that he had been chased and hunted before, but fate preserved him for the immortality of a Museum exhibit. His vertical height at the shoulders is 5 feet 8 inches. The thick hair adds enough to his height to make it full 6 feet. The length of his head and body is 9 feet 2 inches, his girth 8 feet 4 inches and his weight is, or was, about 1,600 pounds. THE TAXIDERMIST\\'S OBJECT LESSONS. This group, with its accessories, is, in point of size, about the biggest thing ever attempted by a taxidermist. It was mounted by Mr. Hornaday, assisted by Messrs. J. Palmer and A. H. Forney. It represents a new departure in mounting specimens for museums. Generally such specimens have been mounted singly, upon a flat surface. The American mammals, collected by Mr. Hornaday, will be mounted in a manner that will make each piece or group an object lesson, telling something of the history and the habits of the animal. The first group produced as one of the results of the Montana hunt comprised three coyotes. Two of them are struggling, and one might almost say snarling, over a bone. They do not stand on a painted board, but on a little patch of soil. Two other groups designed by Mr. Hornaday, and executed by Mr. William Palmer, are about to be placed in the Museum. One of these represents a family of prairie-dogs. They are disposed about a prairie-dog mound. One sits on its haunches eating; others are running about. Across the mouth of the burrow, just ready to disappear into it, is another one, startled for the moment by the sudden appearance of a little burrowing owl that has alighted on one side of the burrow. The owl and the dog are good friends and live together in the same burrow, but there appears to be strained relations between the two for the moment.

He remained with the Cavins until 1885, then farmed for himself. Will lives alone in Marshall, Texas, supported by a $13.00 monthly pension. \"My folks allus belongs to the Cavins and wore their name till after \\'mancipation. Pa and ma was named Freeman and Amelia Cavin and Massa Dave fotches them to Texas from Alabama, along with ma\\'s mother, what we called Maria. \"The Cavins allus thunk lots of their niggers and Grandma Maria say, \\'Why shouldn\\'t they--it was their money.\\' She say there was plenty Indians here when they settled this country and they bought and traded with them without killin\\' them, if they could. The Indians was poor folks, jus\\' pilfer and loaf \\'round all the time. The niggers was a heap sight better off than they was, \\'cause we had plenty to eat and a place to stay. \"Young Massa Tom was my special massa and he still lives here. Old Man Dave seemed to think more of his niggers than anybody and we thunk lots of our white folks. My pa was leader on the farm, and there wasn\\'t no overseer or driver. When pa whip a nigger he needn\\'t go to Massa Dave, but pa say, \\'Go you way, you nigger. Freeman didn\\'t whip you for nothin\\'.\\' Massa Dave allus believe pa, \\'cause he tells the truth. \"One time a peddler come to our house and after supper he goes to see \\'bout his pony. Pa done feed that pony fifteen ears of corn. The peddler tell massa his pony ain\\'t been fed nothin\\', and massa git mad and say, \\'Be on you way iffen you gwine \\'cuse my niggers of lyin\\'.\\' \"We had good quarters and plenty to eat. I \\'members when I\\'s jus\\' walkin\\' round good pa come in from the field at night and taken me out of bed and dress me and feed me and then play with me for hours. Him bein\\' leader, he\\'s gone from \\'fore day till after night. The old heads got out early but us young scraps slep\\' till eight or nine o\\'clock, and don\\'t you think Massa Dave ain\\'t comin\\' round to see we is fed. I \\'members him like it was yest\\'day, comin\\' to the quarters with his stick and askin\\' us, \\'Had your breakfas\\'?\\' We\\'d say, \\'Yes, suh.\\' Then he\\'d ask if we had \\'nough or wanted any more. It look like he taken a pleasure in seein\\' us eat. At dinner, when the field hands come in, it am the same way. He was sho\\' that potlicker was fill as long as the niggers want to eat. \"The hands worked from sun to sun. Massa give them li\\'l crops and let them work them on Saturday. Then he bought the stuff and the niggers go to Jefferson and buy clothes and sech like. Lots saved money and bought freedom \\'fore the war was over. \"We went to church and first the white preacher preached and then he larns our cullud preachers. I seed him ordain a cullud preacher and he told him to allus be honest. When the white preacher laid his hand on him, all the niggers git to hollerin\\' and shoutin\\' and prayin\\' and that nigger git scart mos\\' to death. \"On Christmas we had all we could eat and drink and after that a big party, and you ought to see them gals swingin\\' they partners round. Then massa have two niggers wrestle, and our sports and dances was big sport for the white folks. They\\'d sit on the gallery and watch the niggers put it on brown. \"Massa didn\\'t like his niggers to marry off the place, but sometimes they\\'d do it, and massa tell his neighbor, \\'My nigger am comin\\' to you place. Make him behave.\\' All the niggers \\'haved then and they wasn\\'t no Huntsville and gallows and burnin\\'s then. \"Old massa went to war with his boy, Billie. They\\'s lots of cryin\\' and weepin\\' when they sot us free. Lots of them didn\\'t want to be free, \\'cause they knowed nothin\\' and had nowhere to go. Them what had good massas stayed right on. \"I \\'members when that Ku Klux business starts up. Smart niggers causes that. The carpet-baggers ruint the niggers and the white men couldn\\'t do a thing with them, so they got up the Ku Klux and stirs up the world. Them carpet-baggers come round larnin\\' niggers to sass the white folks what done fed them. They come to pa with that talk and he told them, \\'Listen, white folks, you is gwine start a graveyard if you come round here teachin\\' niggers to sass white folks.\" Them carpet-baggers starts all the trouble at \\'lections in Reconstruction. Niggers didn\\'t know anythin\\' \\'bout politics. \"Mos\\' the young niggers ain\\'t usin\\' the education they got now. I\\'s been here eighty years and still has to be showed and told by white folks. These young niggers won\\'t git told by whites or blacks either. They thinks they done knowed it all and that gits them in trouble. \"I stays with the Cavins mos\\' twenty years after the war. After I leaves, I allus farms and does odd jobs round town here. I\\'s father of ten chillen by one woman. I lives by myself now and they gives me $13.00 a month. I\\'d be proud to git it if it wasn\\'t more\\'n a dollar, \\'cause they ain\\'t nothin\\' a old man can do no more. 420055 [Illustration: William Adams] WILLIAM ADAMS, 93, was born in slavery, with no opportunity for an education, except three months in a public school. He has taught himself to read and to write. His lifelong ambition has been to become master of the supernatural powers which he believes to exist. He is now well-known among Southwestern Negroes for his faith in the occult. \"Yous want to know and talk about de power de people tells you I has. Well, sit down here, right there in dat chair, befo\\' we\\'uns starts. I gits some ice water and den we\\'uns can discuss de subject. I wants to \\'splain it clearly, so yous can understand. \"I\\'s born a slave, 93 years ago, so of course I \\'members de war period. Like all de other slaves I has no chance for edumacation. Three months am de total time I\\'s spent going to school. I teached myself to read and write. I\\'s anxious to larn to read so I could study and find out about many things. Dat, I has done. \"There am lots of folks, and edumacated ones, too, what says we\\'uns believes in superstition. Well, its \\'cause dey don\\'t understand. \\'Member de Lawd, in some of His ways, can be mysterious. De Bible says so. There am some things de Lawd wants all folks to know, some things jus\\' de chosen few to know, and some things no one should know. Now, jus\\' \\'cause yous don\\'t know \\'bout some of de Lawd\\'s laws, \\'taint superstition if some other person understands and believes in sich. \"There is some born to sing, some born to preach, and some born to know de signs. There is some born under de power of de devil and have de power to put injury and misery on people, and some born under de power of de Lawd for to do good and overcome de evil power. Now, dat produces two forces, like fire and water. De evil forces starts de fire and I has de water force to put de fire out. \"How I larnt sich? Well, I\\'s done larn it. It come to me. When de Lawd gives sich power to a person, it jus\\' comes to \\'em. It am 40 years ago now when I\\'s fust fully realize\\' dat I has de power. However, I\\'s allus int\\'rested in de workin\\'s of de signs. When I\\'s a little piccaninny, my mammy and other folks used to talk about de signs. I hears dem talk about what happens to folks \\'cause a spell was put on \\'em. De old folks in dem days knows more about de signs dat de Lawd uses to reveal His laws den de folks of today. It am also true of de cullud folks in Africa, dey native land. Some of de folks laughs at their beliefs and says it am superstition, but it am knowin\\' how de Lawd reveals His laws. \"Now, let me tell yous of something I\\'s seen. What am seen, can\\'t be doubted. It happens when I\\'s a young man and befo\\' I\\'s realize\\' dat I\\'s one dat am chosen for to show de power. A mule had cut his leg so bad dat him am bleedin\\' to death and dey couldn\\'t stop it. An old cullud man live near there dat dey turns to. He comes over and passes his hand over de cut. Befo\\' long de bleedin\\' stop and dat\\'s de power of de Lawd workin\\' through dat nigger, dat\\'s all it am. \"I knows about a woman dat had lost her mind. De doctor say it was caused from a tumor in de head. Dey took an ex-ray picture, but dere\\'s no tumor. Dey gives up and says its a peculiar case. Dat woman was took to one with de power of de good spirit and he say its a peculiar case for dem dat don\\'t understand. Dis am a case of de evil spell. Two days after, de woman have her mind back. \"Dey\\'s lots of dose kind of cases de ord\\'nary person never hear about. Yous hear of de case de doctors can\\'t understand, nor will dey \\'spond to treatment. Dat am \\'cause of de evil spell dat am on de persons. \"\\'Bout special persons bein\\' chosen for to show de power, read yous Bible. It says in de book of Mark, third chapter, \\'and He ordained twelve, dat dey should be with Him, dat He might send them forth to preach and to have de power to heal de sick and to cast out devils.\\' If it wasn\\'t no evil in people, why does de Lawd say, \\'cast out sich?\\' And in de fifth chapter of James, it further say, \\'If any am sick, let him call de elders. Let dem pray over him. De prayers of faith shall save him.\\' There \\'tis again, Faith, dat am what counts. \"When I tells dat I seen many persons given up to die, and den a man with de power comes and saves sich person, den its not for people to say it am superstition to believe in de power. \"Don\\'t forgit--de agents of de devil have de power of evil. Dey can put misery of every kind on people. Dey can make trouble with de work and with de business, with de fam\\'ly and with de health. So folks mus\\' be on de watch all de time. Folks has business trouble \\'cause de evil power have control of \\'em. Dey has de evil power cast out and save de business. There am a man in Waco dat come to see me \\'bout dat. He say to me everything he try to do in de las\\' six months turned out wrong. It starts with him losin\\' his pocketbook with $50.00 in it. He buys a carload of hay and it catch fire and he los\\' all of it. He spends $200.00 advertisin\\' de three-day sale and it begin to rain, so he los\\' money. It sho\\' am de evil power. \"\\'Well,\\' he say, \\'Dat am de way it go, so I comes to you.\\' \"I says to him, \\'Its de evil power dat have you control and we\\'uns shall cause it to be cast out.\\' Its done and he has no more trouble. \"You wants to know if persons with de power for good can be successful in castin\\' out devils in all cases? Well, I answers dat, yes and no. Dey can in every case if de affected person have de faith. If de party not have enough faith, den it am a failure. \"Wearin\\' de coin for protection \\'gainst de evil power? Dat am simple. Lots of folks wears sich and dey uses mixtures dat am sprinkled in de house, and sich. Dat am a question of faith. If dey has de true faith in sich, it works. Otherwise, it won\\'t. \"Some folks won\\'t think for a minute of goin\\' without lodestone or de salt and pepper mixture in de little sack, tied round dey neck. Some wears de silver coin tied round dey neck. All sich am for to keep away de effect of de evil power. When one have de faith in sich and dey acc\\'dently lose de charm, dey sho\\' am miserable. \"An old darky dat has faith in lodestone for de charm told me de \\'sperience he has in Atlanta once. He carryin\\' de hod and de fust thing he does am drop some brick on he foot. De next thing, he foot slip as him starts up de ladder and him and de bricks drap to de ground. It am lucky for him it wasn\\'t far. Jus\\' a sprain ankle and de boss sends him home for de day. He am \\'cited and gits on de street car and when de conductor call for de fare, Rufus reaches for he money but he los\\' it or fergits it at home. De conductor say he let him pay nex\\' time and asks where he live. Rufus tells him and he say, \\'Why, nigger, you is on de wrong car.\\' Dat cause Rufus to walk further with de lame foot dan if he started walkin\\' in de fust place. He thinks there mus\\' be something wrong with he charm, and he look for it and it gone! Sho\\' \\'nough, it am los\\'. He think, \\'Here I sits all day, and I won\\'t make another move till I gits de lodestone. When de chillen comes from school I sends dem to de drugstore for some of de stone and gits fixed.\\' \"Now, now, I\\'s been waitin\\' for dat one \\'bout de black cat crossin\\' de road, and, sho\\' \\'nough, it come. Let me ask you one. How many people can yous find dat likes to have de black cat cross in front of \\'em? Dat\\'s right, no one likes dat. Let dis old cullud person inform yous dat it am sho\\' de bad luck sign. It is sign of bad luck ahead, so turn back. Stop what yous doin\\'. \"I\\'s tellin\\' yous of two of many cases of failure to took warnin\\' from de black cat. I knows a man call\\' Miller. His wife and him am takin\\' an auto ride and de black cat cross de road and he cussed a little and goes on. Den it\\'s not long till he turns de corner and his wife falls out of de car durin\\' de turn. When he goes back and picks her up, she am dead. \"Another fellow, call\\' Brown, was a-ridin\\' hossback and a black cat cross de path, but he drives on. Well, its not long till him hoss stumble and throw him off. De fall breaks his leg, so take a warnin\\'--don\\'t overlook de black cat. Dat am a warnin\\'. 420192 WILLIAM M. ADAMS, spiritualist preacher and healer, who lives at 1404 Illinois Ave., Ft. Worth, Texas, was born a slave on the James Davis plantation, in San Jacinto Co., Texas. After the war he worked in a grocery, punched cattle, farmed and preached. He moved to Ft. Worth in 1902. \"I was bo\\'n 93 years ago, dat is whut my mother says. We didn\\' keep no record like folks does today. All I know is I been yere a long time. My mother, she was Julia Adams and my father he was James Adams. She\\'s bo\\'n in Hollis Springs, Mississippi and my father, now den, he was bo\\'n in Florida. He was a Black Creek Indian. Dere was 12 of us chillen. When I was \\'bout seven de missus, she come and gits me for her servant. I lived in de big house till she die. Her and Marster Davis was powerful good to me. \"Marster Davis he was a big lawyer and de owner of a plantation. But all I do was wait on ole missus. I\\'d light her pipe for her and I helped her wid her knittin\\'. She give me money all de time. She had a little trunk she keeped money in and lots of times I\\'d have to pack it down wid my feets. \"I dis\\'member jus\\' how many slaves dere was, but dere was more\\'n 100. I saw as much as 100 sold at a time. When dey tuk a bunch of slaves to trade, dey put chains on \\'em. \"De other slaves lived in log cabins back of de big house. Dey had dirt floors and beds dat was made out of co\\'n shucks or straw. At nite dey burned de lamps for \\'bout an hour, den de overseers, dey come knock on de door and tell \\'em put de light out. Lots of overseers was mean. Sometimes dey\\'d whip a nigger wid a leather strap \\'bout a foot wide and long as your arm and wid a wooden handle at de end. \"On Sat\\'day and Sunday nites dey\\'d dance and sing all nite long. Dey didn\\' dance like today, dey danced de roun\\' dance and jig and do de pigeon wing, and some of dem would jump up and see how many time he could kick his feets \\'fore dey hit de groun\\'. Dey had an ole fiddle and some of \\'em would take two bones in each hand and rattle \\'em. Dey sang songs like, \\'Diana had a Wooden Leg,\\' and \\'A Hand full of Sugar,\\' and \\'Cotton-eyed Joe.\\' I dis\\'member how dey went. \"De slaves didn\\' have no church den, but dey\\'d take a big sugar kettle and turn it top down on de groun\\' and put logs roun\\' it to kill de soun\\'. Dey\\'d pray to be free and sing and dance. \"When war come dey come and got de slaves from all de plantations and tuk \\'em to build de breastworks. I saw lots of soldiers. Dey\\'d sing a song dat go something like dis: \"\\'Jeff Davis rode a big white hoss, Lincoln rode a mule; Jess Davis is our President, Lincoln is a fool.\\' \"I \\'member when de slaves would run away. Ole John Billinger, he had a bunch of dogs and he\\'d take after runaway niggers. Sometimes de dogs didn\\' ketch de nigger. Den ole Billinger, he\\'d cuss and kick de dogs. \"We didn\\' have to have a pass but on other plantations dey did, or de paddlerollers would git you and whip you. Dey was de poor white folks dat didn\\' have no slaves. We didn\\' call \\'em white folks dem days. No, suh, we called dem\\' Buskrys.\\' \"Jus\\' fore de war, a white preacher he come to us slaves and says: \\'Do you wan\\' to keep you homes whar you git all to eat, and raise your chillen, or do you wan\\' to be free to roam roun\\' without a home, like de wil\\' animals? If you wan\\' to keep you homes you better pray for de South to win. All day wan\\'s to pray for de South to win, raise the hand.\\' We all raised our hands \\'cause we was skeered not to, but we sho\\' didn\\' wan\\' de South to win. \"Dat night all de slaves had a meetin\\' down in de hollow. Ole Uncle Mack, he gits up and says: \\'One time over in Virginny dere was two ole niggers, Uncle Bob and Uncle Tom. Dey was mad at one \\'nuther and one day dey decided to have a dinner and bury de hatchet. So day sat down, and when Uncle Bob wasn\\'t lookin\\' Uncle Tom put some poison in Uncle Bob\\'s food, but he saw it and when Uncle Tom wasn\\'t lookin\\', Uncle Bob he turned de tray roun\\' on Uncle Tom, and he gits de poison food.\\' Uncle Mack, he says: \\'Dat\\'s what we slaves is gwine do, jus\\' turn de tray roun\\' and pray for de North to win.\\' \"After de war dere was a lot of excitement \\'mong de niggers. Dey was rejoicin\\' and singin\\'. Some of \\'em looked puzzled, sorter skeered like. But dey danced and had a big jamboree. \"Lots of \\'em stayed and worked on de halves. Others hired out. I went to work in a grocery store and he paid me $1.50 a week. I give my mother de dollar and keeped de half. Den I got married and farmed for awhile. Den I come to Fort Worth and I been yere since. 420198 SARAH ALLEN was born a slave of John and Sally Goodren, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Before the Civil War, her owners came to Texas, locating near a small town then called Freedom. She lives at 3322 Frutas St., El Paso, Texas. \"I was birthed in time of bondage. You know, some people are ashamed to tell it, but I thank God I was \\'llowed to see them times as well as now. It\\'s a pretty hard story, how cruel some of the marsters was, but I had the luck to be with good white people. But some I knew were put on the block and sold. I \\'member when they\\'d come to John Goodren\\'s place to buy, but he not sell any. They\\'d have certain days when they\\'d sell off the block and they took chillen \\'way from mothers, screamin\\' for dere chillen. \"I was birthed in ole Virginia in de Blue Ridge Mountains. When de white people come to Texas, de cullud people come with them. Dat\\'s been a long time. \"My maw was named Charlotte, my paw Parks Adams. He\\'s a white man. I guess I\\'m about eighty some years ole. \"You know, in slavery times when dey had bad marsters dey\\'d run away, but we didn\\' want to. My missus would see her people had something good to eat every Sunday mornin\\'. You had to mind your missus and marster and you be treated well. I think I was about twelve when dey freed us and we stayed with marster \\'bout a year, then went to John Ecols\\' place and rented some lan\\'. We made two bales of cotton and it was the first money we ever saw. \"Back when we lived with Marster Goodren we had big candy pullin\\'s. Invite everybody and play. We had good times. De worst thing, we didn\\' never have no schoolin\\' till after I married. Den I went to school two weeks. My husban\\' was teacher. He never was a slave. His father bought freedom through a blacksmith shop, some way. \"I had a nice weddin\\'. My dress was white and trimmed with blue ribbon. My second day dress was white with red dots. I had a beautiful veil and a wreath and \\'bout two, three waiters for table dat day. \"My mother was nearly white. Brighter than me. We lef\\' my father in Virginia. I was jus\\' as white as de chillen I played with. I used to be plum bright, but here lately I\\'m gettin\\' awful dark. \"My husban\\' was of a mixture, like you call bright ginger-cake color. I don\\' know where he got his learnin\\'. I feel so bad since he\\'s gone to Glory. \"Now I\\'m ole, de Lord has taken care of me. He put that spirit in people to look after ole folks and now my chillen look after me. I\\'ve two sons, one name James Allen, one R.M. Both live in El Paso. \"After we go to sleep, de people will know these things, \\'cause if freedom hadn\\' come, it would have been so miserable. 420149 ANDY ANDERSON, 94, was born a slave of Jack Haley, who owned a plantation in Williamson Co., Texas. During the Civil War, Andy was sold to W.T. House, of Blanco County, who in less than a year sold Andy to his brother, John House. Andy now lives with his third wife and eight of his children at 301 Armour St., Fort Worth, Texas. \"My name am Andy J. Anderson, and I\\'s born on Massa Jack Haley\\'s plantation in Williamson County, Texas, and Massa Haley owned my folks and \\'bout twelve other families of niggers. I\\'s born in 1843 and that makes me 94 year old and 18 year when de war starts. I\\'s had \\'speriences durin\\' dat time. \"Massa Haley am kind to his cullud folks, and him am kind to everybody, and all de folks likes him. De other white folks called we\\'uns de petted niggers. There am \\'bout 30 old and young niggers and \\'bout 20 piccaninnies too little to work, and de nuss cares for dem while dey mammies works. \"I\\'s gwine \\'splain how it am managed on Massa Haley\\'s plantation. It am sort of like de small town, \\'cause everything we uses am made right there. There am de shoemaker and he is de tanner and make de leather from de hides. Den massa has \\'bout a thousand sheep and he gits de wool, and de niggers cards and spins and weaves it, and dat makes all de clothes. Den massa have cattle and sich purvide de milk and de butter and beef meat for eatin\\'. Den massa have de turkeys and chickens and de hawgs and de bees. With all that, us never was hongry. \"De plantation am planted in cotton, mostly, with de corn and de wheat a little, \\'cause massa don\\'t need much of dem. He never sell nothin\\' but de cotton. \"De livin\\' for de cullud folks am good. De quarters am built from logs like deys all in dem days. De floor am de dirt but we has de benches and what is made on de place. And we has de big fireplace for to cook and we has plenty to cook in dat fireplace, \\'cause massa allus \\'lows plenty good rations, but he watch close for de wastin\\' of de food. \"De war breaks and dat make de big change on de massas place. He jines de army and hires a man call\\' Delbridge for overseer. After dat, de hell start to pop, \\'cause de first thing Delbridge do is cut de rations. He weighs out de meat, three pound for de week, and he measure a peck of meal. And \\'twarn\\'t enough. He half starve us niggers and he want mo\\' work and he start de whippin\\'s. I guesses he starts to edumacate \\'em. I guess dat Delbridge go to hell when he died, but I don\\'t see how de debbil could stand him. \"We\\'uns am not use\\' to sich and some runs off. When dey am cotched there am a whippin\\' at de stake. But dat Delbridge, he sold me to Massa House, in Blanco County. I\\'s sho\\' glad when I\\'s sold, but it am short gladness, \\'cause here am another man what hell am too good for. He gives me de whippin\\' and de scars am still on my arms and my back, too. I\\'ll carry dem to my grave. He sends me for firewood and when I gits it loaded, de wheel hits a stump and de team jerks and dat breaks de whippletree. So he ties me to de stake and every half hour for four hours, dey lays ta lashes on my back. For de first couple hours de pain am awful. I\\'s never forgot it. Den I\\'s stood so much pain I not feel so much and when dey takes me loose, I\\'s jus\\' \\'bout half dead. I lays in de bunk two days, gittin\\' over dat whippin\\', gittin\\' over it in de body but not de heart.

Leon County News--Centerville, Texas--Thursday May 21, 1936. C. Consultant--Uncle Willis Anderson, resident of Centerville, Tex, born April 15, 1844. An interesting character at Centerville, Texas, is \"Uncle Willis\" Anderson, an ex-slave, born April 15, 1844, 6 miles west of Centerville on the old McDaniels plantation near what is now known as Hopewell Settlement. It is generally said that \"Uncle Willis\" is one of the oldest living citizens in the County, black or white. He is referred to generally for information concerning days gone by and for the history of that County, especially in the immediate vicinity of Centerville. \"Uncle Willis\" is an interesting figure. He may be found sitting on the porches of the stores facing Federal Highway No. 75, nodding or conversing with small groups of white or colored people that gather around him telling of the days gone by. He also likes to watch the busses and automobiles that pass through the small town musing and commenting on the swiftness of things today. Uncle Willis still cultivates a small patch five miles out from the town. \"Uncle Willis\" is a tall dark, brown-skinned man having a large head covered with mixed gray wooly hair. He has lost very few teeth considering his age. When sitting on the porches of the stores the soles of his farm-shoes may be seen tied together with pieces of wire. He supports himself with a cane made from the Elm tree. At present he wears a tall white Texas Centennial hat which makes him appear more unique than ever. \"Uncle Willis\\'\" memory is vivid. He is familiar with the older figures in the history of the County. He tells tales of having travelled by oxen to West Texas for flour and being gone for six months at a time. He remembers the Keechi and the Kickapoo Indians and also claims that he can point out a tree where the Americans hung an Indian Chief. He says that he has plowed up arrows, pots and flints on the Reubens Bains place and on the McDaniel farms. He can tell of the early lawlessness in the County. His face lights up when he recalls how the Yankee soldiers came through Centerville telling the slave owners to free their slaves. He also talks very low when he mentions the name of Jeff Davis because he says, \"Wha\\' man eavesdrops the niggers houses in slavery time and if yer\\' sed\\' that Jeff Davis was a good man, they barbecued a hog for you, but if yer\\' sed\\' that Abe Lincoln was a good man, yer\\' had to fight or go to the woods.\" Among the most interesting tales told by \"Uncle Willis\" is the tale of the \"Lead mine.\" \"Uncle Willis\" says that some where along Boggy Creek near a large hickory tree and a red oak tree, near Patrick\\'s Lake, he and his master, Auss McDaniels, would dig lead out of the ground which they used to make pistol and rifle balls for the old Mississippi rifles during slavery time. Uncle Willis claims that they would dig slags of lead out of the ground some 12 and 15 inches long, and others as large as a man\\'s fist. They would carry this ore back to the big house and melt it down to get the trash out of it, then they would pour it into molds and make rifle balls and pistol balls from it. In this way they kept plenty of amunition on hand. In recent years the land has changed ownership, and the present owners live in Dallas. Learning of the tale of the \"lead mine\" on their property they went to Centerville in an attempt to locate it and were referred to \"Uncle Willis.\" Uncle Willis says they offered him two hundred dollars if he could locate the mine. Being so sure that he knew its exact location, said that the $200 was his meat. However, Uncle Willis was unable to locate the spot where they dug the lead and the mine remains a mystery.[C] Recently a group of citizens of Leon County including W.D. Lacey, Joe McDaniel, Debbs Brown, W.H. Hill and Judge Lacey cross questioned Uncle Willis about the lead mine. Judge Lacey did the questioning while them others formed an audience. The conversation went as follows: \"Which way would you go when you went to the mine?\" Judge Lacey asked. \"Out tow\\'hd Normangee.\" \"How long would it take you to get there?\" \"Two or three hours.\" \"Was it on a creek?\" \"Yessuh.\" \"But you cant go to it now?\" \"Nosuh, I just can\\'t recollect exactly where \\'tis.[B] J. Frank Dobie mentions many tales of lost lead mines throughout Texas in Coronado\\'s Children, a publication of the Texas Folk-Lore Society. Lead in the early days of the Republic and the State was very valuable, as it was the source of protection from the Indians and also the means of supplying food.[A] 420056 [Illustration: Mary Armstrong] MARY ARMSTRONG, 91, lives at 3326 Pierce Ave., Houston, Texas. She was born on a farm near St. Louis, Missouri, a slave of William Cleveland. Her father, Sam Adams, belonged to a \"nigger trader,\" who had a farm adjoining the Cleveland place. \"I\\'s Aunt Mary, all right, but you all has to \\'scuse me if I don\\'t talk so good, \\'cause I\\'s been feelin\\' poorly for a spell and I ain\\'t so young no more. Law me, when I think back what I used to do, and now it\\'s all I can do to hobble \\'round a little. Why, Miss Olivia, my mistress, used to put a glass plumb full of water on my head and then have me waltz \\'round the room, and I\\'d dance so smoothlike, I don\\'t spill nary drap. \"That was in St. Louis, where I\\'s born. You see, my mamma belong to old William Cleveland and old Polly Cleveland, and they was the meanest two white folks what ever lived, \\'cause they was allus beatin\\' on their slaves. I know, \\'cause mamma told me, and I hears about it other places, and besides, old Polly, she was a Polly devil if there ever was one, and she whipped my little sister what was only nine months old and jes\\' a baby to death. She come and took the diaper offen my little sister and whipped till the blood jes\\' ran--jes\\' \\'cause she cry like all babies do, and it kilt my sister. I never forgot that, but I sot some even with that old Polly devil and it\\'s this-a-way. \"You see, I\\'s \\'bout 10 year old and I belongs to Miss Olivia, what was that old Polly\\'s daughter, and one day old Polly devil comes to where Miss Olivia lives after she marries, and trys to give me a lick out in the yard, and I picks up a rock \\'bout as big as half your fist and hits her right in the eye and busted the eyeball, and tells her that\\'s for whippin\\' my baby sister to death. You could hear her holler for five miles, but Miss Olivia, when I tells her, says, \\'Well, I guess mamma has larnt her lesson at last.\\' But that old Polly was mean like her husban\\', old Cleveland, till she die, and I hopes they is burnin\\' in torment now. \"I don\\'t \\'member \\'bout the start of things so much, \\'cept what Miss Olivia and my mamma, her name was Siby, tells me. Course, it\\'s powerful cold in winter times and the farms was lots different from down here. They calls \\'em plantations down here but up at St. Louis they was jes\\' called farms, and that\\'s what they was, \\'cause we raises wheat and barley and rye and oats and corn and fruit. \"The houses was builded with brick and heavy wood, too, \\'cause it\\'s cold up there, and we has to wear the warm clothes and they\\'s wove on the place, and we works at it in the evenin\\'s. \"Old Cleveland takes a lot of his slaves what was in \\'custom\\' and brings \\'em to Texas to sell. You know, he wasn\\'t sposed to do that, \\'cause when you\\'s in \\'custom\\', that\\'s \\'cause he borrowed money on you, and you\\'s not sposed to leave the place till he paid up. Course, old Cleveland jes\\' tells the one he owed the money to, you had run off, or squirmed out some way, he was that mean. \"Mamma say she was in one bunch and me in \\'nother. Mamma had been put \\'fore this with my papa, Sam Adams, but that makes no diff\\'rence to Old Cleveland. He\\'s so mean he never would sell the man and woman and chillen to the same one. He\\'d sell the man here and the woman there and if they\\'s chillen, he\\'d sell them some place else. Oh, old Satan in torment couldn\\'t be no meaner than what he and Old Polly was to they slaves. He\\'d chain a nigger up to whip \\'em and rub salt and pepper on him, like he said, \\'to season him up.\\' And when he\\'d sell a slave, he\\'d grease their mouth all up to make it look like they\\'d been fed good and was strong and healthy. \"Well mamma say they hadn\\'t no more\\'n got to Shreveport \\'fore some law man cotch old Cleveland and takes \\'em all back to St. Louis. Then my little sister\\'s born, the one old Polly devil kilt, and I\\'s \\'bout four year old then. \"Miss Olivia takes a likin\\' to me and, though her papa and mama so mean, she\\'s kind to everyone, and they jes\\' love her. She marries to Mr. Will Adams what was a fine man, and has \\'bout five farms and 500 slaves, and he buys me for her from old Cleveland and pays him $2,500.00, and gives him George Henry, a nigger, to boot. Lawsy, I\\'s sho\\' happy to be with Miss Olivia and away from old Cleveland and Old Polly, \\'cause they kilt my little sister. \"We lives in St. Louis, on Chinquapin Hill, and I\\'s housegirl, and when the babies starts to come I nusses \\'em and spins thread for clothes on the loom. I spins six cuts of thread a week, but I has plenty of time for myself and that\\'s where I larns to dance so good. Law, I sho\\' jes\\' crazy \\'bout dancin\\'. If I\\'s settin\\' eatin\\' my victuals and hears a fiddle play, I gets up and dances. \"Mr. Will and Miss Olivia sho\\' is good to me, and I never calls Mr. Will \\'massa\\' neither, but when they\\'s company I calls him Mr. Will and \\'round the house by ourselves I calls them \\'pappy\\' and \\'mammy\\', \\'cause they raises me up from the little girl. I hears old Cleveland done took my mamma to Texas \\'gain but I couldn\\'t do nothin\\', \\'cause Miss Olivia wouldn\\'t have much truck with her folks. Once in a while old Polly comes over, but Miss Olivia tells her not to touch me or the others. Old Polly trys to buy me back from Miss Olivia, and if they had they\\'d kilt me sho\\'. But Miss Olivia say, \\'I\\'d wade in blood as deep as Hell \\'fore I\\'d let you have Mary.\\' That\\'s jes\\' the very words she told \\'em. \"Then I hears my papa is sold some place I don\\'t know where. \\'Course, I didn\\'t know him so well, jes\\' what mamma done told me, so that didn\\'t worry me like mamma being took so far away. \"One day Mr. Will say, \\'Mary, you want to go to the river and see the boat race?\\' Law me, I never won\\'t forget that. Where we live it ain\\'t far to the Miss\\'sippi River and pretty soon here they comes, the Natchez and the Eclipse, with smoke and fire jes\\' pourin\\' out of they smokestacks. That old captain on the \\'Clipse starts puttin\\' in bacon meat in the boiler and the grease jes\\' comes out a-blazin\\' and it beat the Natchez to pieces. \"I stays with Miss Olivia till \\'63 when Mr. Will set us all free. I was \\'bout 17 year old then or more. I say I goin\\' find my mamma. Mr. Will fixes me up two papers, one \\'bout a yard long and the other some smaller, but both has big, gold seals what he says is the seal of the State of Missouri. He gives me money and buys my fare ticket to Texas and tells me they is still slave times down here and to put the papers in my bosom but to do whatever the white folks tells me, even if they wants to sell me. But he say, \\'Fore you gets off the block, jes\\' pull out the papers, but jes\\' hold \\'em up to let folks see and don\\'t let \\'em out of your hands, and when they sees them they has to let you alone.\\' \"Miss Olivia cry and carry on and say be careful of myself \\'cause it sho\\' rough in Texas. She give me a big basket what had so much to eat in it I couldn\\'t hardly heft it and \\'nother with clothes in it. They puts me in the back end a the boat where the big, old wheel what run the boat was and I goes to New Orleans, and the captain puts me on \\'nother boat and I comes to Galveston, and that captain puts me on \\'nother boat and I comes up this here Buffalo Bayou to Houston. \"I looks \\'round Houston, but not long. It sho\\' was a dumpy little place then and I gets the stagecoach to Austin. It takes us two days to get there and I thinks my back busted sho\\' \\'nough, it was sich rough ridin\\'. Then I has trouble sho\\'. A man asks me where I goin\\' and says to come \\'long and he takes me to a Mr. Charley Crosby. They takes me to the block what they sells slaves on. I gets right up like they tells me, \\'cause I \\'lects what Mr. Will done told me to do, and they starts biddin\\' on me. And when they cried off and this Mr. Crosby comes up to get me, I jes\\' pulled out my papers and helt \\'em up high and when he sees \\'em, he say, \\'Let me see them.\\' But I says, \\'You jes\\' look at it up here,\\' and he squints up and say, \\'This gal am free and has papers,\\' and tells me he a legislature man and takes me and lets me stay with his slaves. He is a good man. \"He tells me there\\'s a slave refugee camp in Wharton County but I didn\\'t have no money left, but he pays me some for workin\\' and when the war\\'s over I starts to hunt mamma \\'gain, and finds her in Wharton County near where Wharton is. Law me, talk \\'bout cryin\\' and singin\\' and cryin\\' some more, we sure done it. I stays with mamma till I gets married in 1871 to John Armstrong, and then we all comes to Houston. \"I gets me a job nussin\\' for Dr. Rellaford and was all through the yellow fever epidemic. I \\'lects in \\'75 people die jes\\' like sheep with the rots. I\\'s seen folks with the fever jump from their bed with death on \\'em and grab other folks. The doctor saved lots of folks, white and black, \\'cause he sweat it out of \\'em. He mixed up hot water and vinegar and mustard and some else in it. \"But, law me, so much is gone out of my mind, \\'cause I\\'s 91 year old now and my mind jes\\' like my legs, jes\\' kinda hobble \\'round a bit. 420085 [Illustration: Sterlin Arnwine] STEARLIN ARNWINE, 94, was born a slave to Albertus Arnwine, near Jacksonville, Texas, who died when Stearlin was seven or eight. He was bought by John Moseley, of Rusk, Texas, who made Stearlin a houseboy, and was very kind to him. He now lives about six miles west of Jacksonville. \"I was bo\\'n \\'fore de war, in 1853, right near this here town, on Gum Creek. My mammy belonged to Massa Albertus Arnwine, and he wasn\\' ever married. He owned four women, my mammy, Ann, my grandmother, Gracie, and my Aunt Winnie and Aunt Mary. He didn\\' own any nigger men, \\'cept the chillen of these women. Grandma lived in de house with Massa Arnwine and the rest of us lived in cabins in de ya\\'d. My mammy come from Memphis but I don\\' know whar my pappy come from. He was Ike Lane. I has three half brothers, and their names is Joe and Will and John Schot, and two sisters called Polly and Rosie. \"Massa Arnwine died \\'fore de war and he made a will and it gave all he owned to the women he owned, and Jedge Jowell promised massa on his deathbed he would take us to de free country, but he didn\\'. He took us to his place to work for him for \\'bout two years and the women never did get that 900 acres of land Massa Arnwine willed to\\'em. I don\\' know who got it, but they didn\\'. I knows I still has a share in that land, but it takes money to git it in cou\\'t. \"When war broke I fell into the han\\'s of Massa John Moseley at Rusk. They brought the dogs to roun\\' us up from the fiel\\'s whar we was workin\\'. I was the only one of my fam\\'ly to go to Massa John. \"I never did wo\\'k in the fiel\\'s at Massa John\\'s place. He said I mus\\' be his houseboy and houseboy I was. Massa was sho\\' good to me and I did love to be with him and follow him \\'roun\\'. \"The kitchen was out in de ya\\'d and I had to carry the victuals to the big dinin\\'-room. When dinner was over, Massa John tuk a nap and I had to fan him, and Lawsy me, I\\'d git so sleepy. I kin hear him now, for he\\'d wake up and say, \\'Go get me a drink outta the northeast corner of de well.\\' \"We had straw and grass beds, we put it in sacks on de groun\\' and slep\\' on de sacks. I don\\' \\'member how much land Massa John had but it was a big place and he had lots of slaves. We chillun had supper early in de evenin\\' and mostly cornbread and hawg meat and milk. We all ate from a big pot. I larned to spin and weave and knit and made lots of socks. \"Massa John had two step-daughters, Miss Mollie and Miss Laura, and they wen\\' to school at Rusk. It was my job to take \\'em thar ev\\'ry Monday mornin\\' on horses and go back after \\'em Friday afternoon. \"I never earnt no money \\'fore freedom come, but once my brother-in-law give me five dollars. I was so proud of it I showed it to de ladies and one of \\'em said, \\'You don\\' need dat,\\' and she give me two sticks of candy and tuk de money. But I didn\\' know any better then. \"I seed slaves for sale on de auction block. They sol\\' \\'em \\'cordin\\' to strengt\\' and muscles. They was stripped to de wais\\'. I seed the women and little chillun cryin\\' and beggin\\' not to be separated, but it didn\\' do no good. They had to go. \"The only chu\\'ch I knowed \\'bout was when we\\'d git together in de night and have prayer meetin\\' and singin.\\' We use\\' to go way out in de woods so de white folks wouldn\\' hear nothin\\'. Sometimes we\\'d stay nearly all night on Saturday, \\'cause we didn\\' have to work Sunday. \"\\'Bout the only thing we could play was stick hosses. I made miles and miles on the stick hosses. After the War Massa John have his chillun a big roll of Confederate money and they give us some of it to trade and buy stick hosses with. \"When Massa John tol\\' us we was free, he didn\\' seem to min\\', but Miss Em, she bawled and squalled, say her prop\\'ty taken \\'way from her. After dat, my mammy gathers us togedder and tuk us to the Dr. Middleton place, out from Jacksonville. From thar to de Ragsdale place whar I\\'s been ever since. \"I wore my first pants when I was fourteen years ole, and they stung \\'till I was mis\\'ble.

JOHN BARCLAY (nee Sarah Sanders) Brownwood, Texas was born in Komo, Mississippi, September 1, 1853. She was born a slave at the North Slades\\' place. Mr. and Mrs. North Slade were the only owners she ever had. She served as nurse-maid for her marster\\'s children and did general housework. She, with her mother and father and family stayed with the Slades until the end of the year after the Civil War. They then moved to themselves, hiring out to \"White Folks.\" \"My marster and mistress was good to all de slaves dat worked for dem. But our over-seer, Jimmy Shearer, was sho\\' mean. One day he done git mad at me for some little somethin\\' and when I take de ashes to de garden he catches me and churns me up and down on de groun\\'. One day he got mad at my brother and kicked him end over end, jes\\' like a stick of wood. He would whip us \\'til we was raw and then put pepper and salt in de sores. If he thought we was too slow in doin\\' anything he would kick us off de groun\\' and churn us up and down. Our punishment depended on de mood of de over-seer. I never did see no slaves sold. When we was sick dey give us medicine out of drug stores. De over-seer would git some coarse cotton cloth to make our work clothes out of and den he would make dem so narrow we couldn\\' hardly\\' walk. \"There was 1800 acres in Marster Slade\\'s plantation, we got up at 5:00 o\\'clock in de mornin\\' and de field workers would quit after sun-down. We didn\\' have no jails for slaves. We went to church with de white folks and there was a place in de back of de church for us to sit. \"I was jes\\' a child den and us chilluns would gather in de back yard and sing songs and play games and dance jigs. Song I \\'member most is \\'The Day is Past and Gone.\\' \"One time marster found out the over-seer was so mean to me, so he discharged him and released me from duty for awhile. \"We never did wear shoes through de week but on Sunday we would dress up in our white cotton dresses and put on shoes. \"We wasn\\'t taught to read or write. Our owner didn\\'t think anything about it. We had to work if there was work to be done. When we got caught up den we could have time off. If any of us got sick our mistress would \\'tend to us herself. If she thought we was sick enough she would call de white doctor. \"When de marster done told us we was free we jumped up and down and slapped our hands and shouted \\'Glory to God!\\' Lord, child dat was one happy bunch of niggers. Awhile after dat some of de slaves told marster dey wanted to stay on with him like dey had been but he told \\'em no dey couldn\\'t, \\'cause dey was free. He said he could use some of \\'em but dey would have to buy what dey got and he would have to pay \\'em like men. \"When I was \\'bout 18 years old I married John Barclay. I\\'s had ten chillun and four gran\\'-chillun and now I lives by myself.\" 420128 JOHN BARKER, age 84, Houston. 5 photographs marked _Green Cumby_ have been assigned to this manuscript--the \\'Green Cumby\\' photos are attached to the proper manuscript and the five referred to above are probably pictures of _John Barker_. JOHN BARKER, age 84, was born near Cincinnati, Ohio, the property of the Barker family, who moved to Missouri and later to Texas. He and his wife live in a neat cottage in Houston, Texas. \"I was born a slave. I\\'m a Malagasser (Madagascar) nigger. I \\'member all \\'bout dem times, even up in Ohio, though de Barkers brought me to Texas later on. My mother and father was call Goodman, but dey died when I was little and Missy Barker raised me on de plantation down near Houston. Dey was plenty of work and plenty of room. \"I \\'member my grandma and grandpa. In dem days de horned toads runs over de world and my grandpa would gather \\'em and lay \\'em in de fireplace till dey dried and roll \\'em with bottles till dey like ashes and den rub it on de shoe bottoms. You see, when dey wants to run away, dat stuff don\\'t stick all on de shoes, it stick to de track. Den dey carries some of dat powder and throws it as far as dey could jump and den jump over it, and do dat again till dey use all de powder. Dat throwed de common hounds off de trail altogether. But dey have de bloodhounds, hell hounds, we calls \\'em, and dey could pick up dat trail. Dey run my grandpa over 100 mile and three or four days and nights and found him under a bridge. What dey put on him was enough! I seen \\'em whip runaway niggers till de blood run down dere backs and den put salt in de places. \"I \\'spect dere was \\'bout 40 or 50 acres in de plantation. Dey worked and worked and didn\\'t have no dances or church. Dances nothin! \"My massa and missus house was nice, but it was a log house. They had big fireplaces what took great big chunks of wood and kep\\' fire all night. We lives in de back in a little bitty house like a chicken house. We makes beds out of posts and slats across \\'em and fills tow sacks with shucks in \\'em for mattress and pillows. \"I seed slaves sold and they was yoked like steers and sold by pairs sometimes. Dey wasn\\'t \\'lowed to marry, \\'cause they could be sold and it wasn\\'t no use, but you could live with \\'em. \"We used to eat possums and dese old-fashioned coons and ducks. Sometimes we\\'d eat goats, too. We has plenty cornmeal and \\'lasses and we gets milk sometimes, but we has no fine food, \\'cept on Christmas, we gits some cake, maybe. \"My grandma says one day dat we all is free, but we stayed with Massa Barker quite a while. Dey pays us for workin\\' but it ain\\'t much pay, \\'cause de war done took dere money and all. But they was good to us, so we stayed. \"I was \\'bout 20 when I marries de fust time. It was a big blow-out and I was scared de whole time. First time I ever tackled marryin\\'. Dey had a big paper sack of rice and throwed it all over her and I, enough rice to last three or four days, throwed away jus\\' for nothin\\'. I had on a black, alpaca suit with frock tail coat and, if I ain\\'t mistaken, a right white shirt. My wife have a great train on her dress and one dem things you call a wreath. I wore de loudest shoes we could find, what you call patent leather. \"Dis here my third wife.

And on dark nights I seed ghosties what has no head. Dey looks like dey wild and dey is all in different performance. When I goin\\' down de road and feel a hot steam and look over my shoulder I can see \\'em plain as you standin\\' dere.

He is very feeble, but keeps his great grandchildren in line while their mother works. They live in Beaumont. Joe is tall, slight, and has gray hair and a stubby gray mustache. In his kind, gentle voice he relates his experiences in slavery days. \"Dey calls me Paul Barnes, but my name ain\\'t Paul, it am Joe.

He is the husband of Harriett Barrett. Armstead has a very poor memory and can tell little about early days. He and Harriet receive old age pensions. \"I\\'s really owned by Massa Stafford Barrett, but my mammy \\'longed to Massa Ben Walker and was \\'lowed to keep me with her. So after we\\'uns got free, I lives with my daddy and mammy and goes by de name of Barrett. Daddy\\'s name was Henry Barrett and he\\'s brung to Texas from Richmond, in Virginny, and mammy come from Kentucky. Us all lived in Huntsville.

We have to take care all dat now and de white man, he beats de nigger out what he makes. Back in de old days, de white men am hones\\'. All the nigger knowed was hard work.

They wont do right, but I \\'lieve iffen dey could git fair wages dey\\'d do better.

When still very young, John moved with his mother, a slave of Harry Hogan, to Limestone Co., Texas. John now lives in Corsicana, supported by his children and an old age pension. \"My pappy was Ike Bateman, \\'cause his massa\\'s name am Mock Bateman, and mammy\\'s name was Francis.

A great-grandson climbed into Harrison\\'s lap during the interview, and his genial face lit up with a smile. He chuckled as he told of his own boyhood days, and appeared to enjoy reminiscing. At times he uses big words, some of his own coining. \"I\\'s \\'mong de culls now, like a hoss what am too old. I\\'s purty small yit when \\'mancipation comes and didn\\'t have no hard work. Old Massa have me and de other li\\'l niggers keep de stock out de fields. Us li\\'l boogers have to run and keep de cows out de corn and de cotton patch.

Frank lives in Madisonville, Texas. \"I was owned by Johnson Bell and born in New Orleans, in Louisiana. \\'Cordin\\' to the bill of sale, I\\'m eighty-six years old, and my master was a Frenchman and was real mean to me. He run saloon and kept bad women. I don\\'t know nothing \\'bout my folks, if I even had any, \\'cept mama. They done tell me she was a bad woman and a French Creole. \"I worked \\'round master\\'s saloon, kep\\' everything cleaned up after they\\'d have all night drinkin\\' parties, men and women. I earned nickels to tip off where to go, so\\'s they could sow wild oats. I buried the nickels under rocks. If master done cotch me with money, he\\'d take it and beat me nearly to death. All I had to eat was old stuff those people left, all scraps what was left. \"One time some bad men come to master\\'s and gits in a shootin\\' scrape and they was two men kilt. I sho\\' did run. But master cotch me and make me take them men to the river and tie a weight on them, so they\\'d sink and the law wouldn\\'t git him. \"The clothes I wore was some master\\'s old ones. They allus had holes in them. Master he stay drunk nearly all time and was mean to his slave. I\\'m the only one he had, and didn\\'t cost him nothing. He have bill of sale made, \\'cause the law say he done stole me when I\\'m small child. Master kept me in chains sometimes. He shot several men. \"I didn\\'t have no quarters but stays \\'round the place and throw old sack down and lay there and sleep. I\\'m \\'fraid to run, \\'cause master say he\\'d hunt me and kill nigger. \"When I\\'s \\'bout seventeen I marries a gal while master on drunk spell. Master he run her off, and I slips off at night to see her, but he finds it out. He takes a big, long knife and cuts her head plumb off, and ties a great, heavy weight to her and makes me throw her in the river. Then he puts me in chains and every night he come give me a whippin\\', for long time. \"When war come, master swear he not gwine fight, but the Yankees they captures New Orleans and throws master in a pen and guards him. He gets a chance and \\'scapes. \"When war am over he won\\'t free me, says I\\'m valuable to him in his trade. He say, \\'Nigger, you\\'s suppose to be free but I\\'ll pay you a dollar a week and iffen you runs off I\\'ll kill you.\\' So he makes me do like befo\\' the war, but give me \\'bout a dollar a month, \\'stead week. \"He say I cost more\\'n I\\'m worth, but he won\\'t let me go. Times I don\\'t know why I didn\\'t die befo\\' I\\'m growed, sleepin\\' on the ground, winter and summer, rain and snow. But not much snow there. \"Master helt me long years after the war. If anybody git after him, he told them I stay \\'cause I wants to stay, but told me if I left he\\'d kill him \\'nother nigger. I stayed till he gits in a drunk brawl one night with men and women and they gits to shootin\\' and some kilt. Master got kilt. Then I\\'m left to live or die, so I wanders from place to place. I nearly starved to death befo\\' I\\'d leave New Orleans, \\'cause I couldn\\'t think master am dead and I\\'m \\'fraid. Finally I gits up nerve to leave town, and stays the first night in white man\\'s barn. I never slep\\'. Every time I hears something, I jumps up and master be standin\\' there, lookin\\' at me, but soon\\'s I git up he\\'d leave. Next night I slep\\' out in a hay field, and master he git right top of a tree and start hollerin at me. I never stays in that place. I gits gone from that place. I gits back to town fast as my legs carry me. \"Then I gits locked up in jail. I don\\'t know what for, never did know. One the men says to me to come with him and takes me to the woods and gives me an ax. I cuts rails till I nearly falls, all with chain locked \\'round feet, so I couldn\\'t run off. He turns me loose and I wanders \\'gain. Never had a home. Works for men long \\'nough to git fifty, sixty cents, then starts roamin\\' \\'gain, like a stray dog like. \"After long time I marries Feline Graham. Then I has a home and we has a white preacher marry us. We has one boy and he farms and I lives with him. I worked at sawmill and farms all my life, but never could make much money. \"You know, the nigger was wild till the white man made what he has out of the nigger. He done ed\\'cate them real smart. 420193 Aunt VIRGINIA BELL, 1205 Ruthven St., Houston, was born a slave near Opelousas, Louisiana, on the plantation of Thomas Lewis. Although she remembers being told she was born on Christmas Day, she does not know the year, but says she guesses she is about 88 years old. \"Well, suh, the fus\\' question you ask me, \\'bout how old I is, I don\\' know \\'zactly. You see it ain\\'t like things is today. The young folks can tell you their \\'zact age and everything, but in those days we didn\\' pay much \\'tention to such things. But I knows I was bo\\'n in slavery times and my pappy tol\\' me I was bo\\'n on a Christmas Day, but didn\\' \\'member jus\\' what year. \"We was owned by Massa Lewis. Thomas Lewis was his name, and he was a United States lawyer. I ain\\'t gwineter talk \\'gainst my white folks like some cullud folks do, \\'cause Massa Lewis was a mighty fine man and so was Miss Mary, and they treated us mighty good. \"Massa had a big plantation near Opelousas and I was bo\\'n there. I \\'member the neighbor folks used to bring their cotton to the gin on his farm for ginnin\\' and balin\\'. My mother\\'s name was Della. That was all, jus\\' Della. My pappy\\'s name was Jim Blair. Both of them was from Virginny, but from diff\\'rent places, and was brought to Louisiana by nigger traders and sold to Massa Lewis. I know my pappy was lots older than my mother and he had a wife and five chillen back in Virginny and had been sold away from them out here. Then he and my mother started a family out here. I don\\' know what become of his family back in Virginny, \\'cause when we was freed he stayed with us. \"When I got old enough I was housegirl and used to carry notes for Miss Mary to the neighbors and bring back answers. Miss Mary would say, \\'Now, Virginny, you take this note to sech and sech place and be sure and be back in sech and sech time,\\' and I allus was. \"Massa Lewis had four or five families of us slaves, but we used to have some fun after work and us young folks would skip rope and play ring games. Durin\\' week days the field hands would work till the sun was jus\\' goin\\' down and then the overseer would holler \\'all right\\' and that was the signal to quit. All hands knocked off Sat\\'day noon. \"We didn\\' have no schoolin\\' or preachin\\'. Only the white folks had them, but sometimes on Sundays we\\'d go up to the house and listen to the white folks singin\\'. \"Iffen any of the slave hands wanted to git married, Massa Lewis would git them up to the house after supper time, have the man and woman jine hands and then read to them outen a book. I guess it was the Scriptures. Then he\\'d tell \\'em they was married but to be ready for work in the mornin\\'. Massa Lewis married us \\'cordin\\' to Gospel. \"Massa used to feed us good, too, and we had plenty clothes. Iffen we got took sick, we had doctor treatment, too. Iffen a hand took sick in the field with a misery, they was carried to their quarters and Massa or Miss Mary would give them a dose of epecac and make them vomit and would sen\\' for the doctor. They wouldn\\' fool none iffen one of us took sick, but would clean us out and take care of us till we was well. \"There was mighty little whippin\\' goin\\' on at our place, \\'cause Massa Lewis and Miss Mary treated us good. They wasn\\'t no overseer goin\\' to whip, \\'cause Massa wouldn\\' \\'low him to. Le\\'s see, I don\\' rec\\'lec\\' more than two whippin\\'s I see anyone git from Massa, and that has been so long ago I don\\' rec\\'lec\\' what they was for. \"When the War done come \\'long it sho\\' changed things, and we heerd this and that, but we didn\\' know much what it was about. Then one day Massa Lewis had all the wagons loaded with food and chairs and beds and other things from the house and our quarters, and I heerd him say we was movin\\' to Polk County, way over in Texas. I know it took us a long time to git there, and when we did I never see so much woods. It sho\\' was diff\\'rent from the plantation. \"I had to work in the fields, same as the res\\', and we stayed there three years and made three crops of cotton, but not so much as on our old place, \\'cause there wasn\\'t so much clearin\\'. Then one day Massa Lewis tol\\' us we was free, jus\\' as free as he was--jus\\' like you take the bridle offen a hoss and turn him loose. We jus\\' looked \\'roun as iffen we hadn\\' good sense. We didn\\' have nothin\\' nor nowhere to go, and Massa Lewis say iffen we finish makin\\' de crop, he would take us back to Opelousas and give us a place to stay and feed us. So after pickin\\' we goes back and when we git there we sees where those rascal Yankees \\'stroyed everything--houses burned, sugar kettles broke up. It looked mighty bad. \"Massa Lewis hadn\\' no money, but he fixed us up a place to stay and give us what he could to eat, but things was mighty hard for a while. I know pappy used to catch rabbits and take them to town and sell them or trade them for somethin\\' to eat, and you know that wasn\\'t much, \\'cause you can\\'t git much for a little ol\\' rabbit. \"Then the Provo\\' Marshal, that was his name, give us a order for things to put in a crop with and to live till we made the crop. \\'Course, I guess we wasn\\' as bad off as some, \\'cause white folks knew we was Massa Lewis\\' folks and didn\\' bother us none. Then I got married to John Bell, and it was a scripture weddin\\', too. He died 28 years ago, but I has stayed married to him ever since. We had thirteen chillen, but they is all dead now \\'cept four, but they was raised up right and they is mighty good to they ol\\' mammy. 420114 [Illustration: Edgar and Minerva Bendy] EDGAR BENDY, 90 odd years, was the slave of Henry Bendy, of Woodville, Texas, has to make an effort to remember and is forced to seek aid from his wife, Minerva, at certain points in his story. Edgar has lived in Woodville all his life. \"I\\'s a good size\\' boy when de war gwine on and I seed de soldiers come right here in Woodville. A big bunch of dem come through and dey have cannons with dem. My marster he didn\\'t go to war, \\'cause he too old, I guess. \"I\\'s born right here and done live hereabouts every since. Old man Henry Bendy, he my marster and he run de store here in Woodville and have de farm, too. I didn\\'t do nothin\\' \\'cept nuss babies. I jes\\' jump dem up and down and de old marster hire me out to nuss other white folks chillen, big and little. \"My daddy name\\' Jack Crews and my mammy was Winnie. Both of dem worked on de farm and I never seed dem much. I didn\\'t have no house of my own, \\'cause de marster, he give me de room in he house. He have lots of slaves and \\'bout 100 acres in cult\\'vation. He gave dem plenty to eat and good homespun clothes to wear. He was mighty good. \"Marster have de plank house and all de things in it was home-made. De cook was a old cullud woman and I eat at de kitchen table and have de same what de white folks eats. Us has lots of meat, deer meat and possum and coon and sich, and us sets traps for birds. \"Dey ain\\'t nothin\\' better dat go in de wood dan de big, fat possum. Dey git fat on black haws and acorns and chinquapin and sich. Chinquapin is good for people to eat and to roast. I used to be plumb give up to be de best hunter in Tyler and in de whole country. I kilt more deer dan any other man in de county and I been guide for all de big men what comes here to hunt. My wife, Minerva, she used to go huntin\\' with me. \"I kep\\' on huntin\\' and huntin\\' till de Jack-a-my-lanterns git after me. Dat a light you sees all \\'round you. Dey follow all \\'long and dey stop you still. Den one time it git all over me. Come like de wind, blow, blow, and come jes\\' like fire all on my arm and my clothes and things. When dat git after me I quit huntin\\' at nighttime and ain\\'t been huntin\\' since. \"One time I fishin\\' on de creek and I ain\\'t got no gun, and I look up and dere a big, wild cat. He never pay me no mind, no more dan nothin\\', but dat ain\\'t made no diff\\'rence to me. I jes\\' flew in dat creek! \"I used to belong to de lodge but when I git so old I couldn\\'t pay my jews, I git unfinancial and I ain\\'t a member no more. 420174 MINERVA BENDY, 83, was born a slave to Lazarus Goolsby, Henry Co. Alabama, who brought her to Texas when she was five. They settled near Woodville, where Minerva still lives. \"My earlies\\' \\'membrance was de big, white sandy road what lead \\'way from de house. It was clean and white and us chillen love to walk in de soft, hot sand. Dat in Henry County, Alabama, where I\\'s born and my old marster was Lazarus Goolsby and he have de big plantation with lots of nigger folks. I \\'member jus\\' as good as yesterday wigglin\\' my toes in dat sandy road and runnin\\' \\'way to de grits mill where dey grind de meal. Dat have de big water wheel dat sing and squeak as it go \\'round. \"Aunt Mary, she make all us little chillen sleep in de heat of de day under de big, spreadin\\' oak tree in de yard. My mama have 17 chillen. Her name Dollie and my daddy name Herd. \"I\\'s jus\\' a little chile in dem days and I stay in de house with de white folks. Dey raise me a pet in de family. Missus Goolsby, she have two gals and dey give me to de oldest. When she die dey put me in de bed with her but iffen I knowed she dyin\\' dey wouldn\\'t been able to cotch me. She rub my head and tell her papa and mama, \\'I\\'s gwine \\'way but I wants you promise you ain\\'t never whip my little nigger.\\' Dey never did. \"I\\'s jus\\' \\'bout five year old when us make de trip to Texas. Us come right near Woodville and make de plantation. It a big place and dey raise corn and cotton and cane. We makes our own sugar and has many as six kettle on de furnace at one time. Dey raise dey tobacco, too. I\\'s sick and a old man he say he make me tobacco medicine and dey dry de leafs and make dem sweet like sugar and feed me like candy. \"I \\'member old marster say war broke out and Capt. Collier\\'s men was a-drillin\\' right dere south of Woodville. All de wives and chillen watch dem drill. Dey was lots of dem, but I couldn\\'t count. De whole shebang from de town go watch dem. \"Four of the Goolsby boys goes to dat war and dey call John and Ziby and Zabud and Addison. Zabud, he git wounded, no he git kilt, and Addison he git wounded. I worry den, \\'cause I ain\\'t see no reason for dem to have to die. \"After us free dey turn us loose in de woods and dat de bad time, \\'cause most us didn\\'t know where to turn. I wasn\\'t raise to do nothin\\' and I didn\\'t know how. Dey didn\\'t even give us a hoecake or a slice of bacon. \"I\\'s a June bride 59 year ago when I git married.

In 1867 she married Cal Benjamin and they settled in Corsicana, Texas, where Sarah now lives. \"I is Sarah Benjamin and is 82 year old, \\'cause my mammy told me I\\'s born in 1855 in Clavin Parish in Louisiana.

He had a smokehouse big as a church and it was full, and in de big kitchen we all et, chillen and all. De grown folks et first and den de chillen. Did we have plenty of possums and fish by de barrels full! All dis was cooked in de racks over de fireplace and it were good. \"Our clothes was all homespun and de shoes made by de shoemaker. Old marse wanted all us to go to church and if dey didn\\'t have shoes dey have something like de moccasin. \"I don\\'t know how many slaves there was, but it was a lot, maybe 60 or 70. Dey worked hard every day \\'cept Sunday. Iffen they was bad they might git whuppin\\'s, but not too hard, not to de blood. Iffen dey was still bad, dey puts chains on dem and puts dem in de stocks, \\'cause there wasn\\'t no jail there. \"Once when I\\'s little, marse stripped me stark modern naked and puts me on de block, but he wouldn\\'t sell me, \\'cause he was bid only $350.00 and he say no, \\'cause I was good and fat. \"Dey didn\\'t larn us nothin\\' and iffen you did larn to write, you better keep it to yourse\\'f, \\'cause some slaves got de thumb or finger cut off for larnin\\' to write.

He worked with stock as a very young boy and this was his duty during and after the Civil War, as he remained with his boss for three years after emancipation. He then came to old Ben Ficklin four miles south of the present San Angelo, Texas, when it was the county seat of Tom Green County and before there was a San Angelo. He continued his work on ranches here and has never done any other kind of work. For the past several years he has been very feeble and has made his home with a daughter in San Angelo, Texas. Jack who was assisted out of bed and dressed by his grandson, hobbled in on his cane and said, \"I was jes\\' a small boy workin\\' on de ranch when I hear talk \\'bout conscription\\' de men for de war what was agoin\\' to set de slaves free.

I jes\\' keeps on workin\\' wid my hosses and my cattle (dere wasn\\'t no sheep den) jes\\' like dere wasn\\'t no war, \\'cause dat was all I ever knowed how to do. \"Our ole marster, he wasn\\'t so very mean to us, course he whips us once and awhile but dat wasn\\'t like de slave holders what had dem colored drivers. Dey sho\\' was rough on de slaves. I\\'s been told lots \\'bout de chains and de diffe\\'nt punishments but our treatment wasn\\'t so bad. Our beds was pretty good when we uses dem.

He plant little bitty patches close to de house and each li\\'l nigger have a patch and he work it till it got growed. Marse have de house girls make popcorn for \\'em and candy. \"I nuss de sick folks too. Sometime I dose with Blue Mass pills and sometime Dr. Fawcett leave rhubarb and ipicac and calomel and castor oil and sech. Two year after de war, I git marry and git chillen of my own and den I turn into de wet nuss. I wet nuss de white chillen and black chillen, like dey all de same color. Sometime I have a white\\'un pullin\\' de one side and a black one de other. \"I wanted to git de papers for midwifin\\' but, law, I don\\'t never have no time for larnin\\' in slave time. If Marse cotch a paper in you hand he sho\\' whop you. He don\\'t \\'low no bright niggers \\'round, he sell \\'em quick. He allus say, \\'Book larnin\\' don\\'t raise no good sugar cane.\\' De only larnin\\' he \\'low was when dey larn de cullud chillen de Methodist catechism. De only writin\\' a nigger ever git, am when he git born or marry or die, den Marse put de name in de big book. Law, I \\'lect de time Marse marry Miss Cornelia. He went on de mail boat and brung her from New Orleans. She de pretties\\' woman in de world almost, \\'ceptin\\' she have de bigges\\' mouth I nearly ever seed. He brung her up to de house and all de niggers and boys and girls and cats and dogs and sech come and salute her. Dere she stand on de gallery, with a purty white dress on with red stripes runnin\\' up and down. Marse say to her, \\'Honey, see all de black folks, dey \\'longs to you now.\\' She wave to us and smile on us and nex\\' day she give her weddin\\' dress to my ma. Dat de fines\\' dress I ever seen. It was purple and green silk and all de nigger gals wear dat dress when dey git marry. My sister Sidney wore it and Sary and Mary. \"Miss Cornelia was de fines\\' woman in de world. Come Sunday mornin\\' she done put a bucket of dimes on de front gallery and stand dere and throw dimes to de nigger chillen jes\\' like feedin\\' chickens. I sho\\' right here to test\\'fy, \\'cause I\\'s right dere helpin\\' grab. Sometime she done put da washtub of buttermilk on de back gallery and us chillen bring us gourds and dip up dat good, old buttermilk till it all git drunk up. Sometime she fotch bread and butter to de back gallery and pass it out when it don\\'t even come mealtime. \"Miss Cornelia set my ma to cuttin\\' patterns and sewin\\' right away. She give all de women a bolt or linsey to make clothes and ma cut de pattern. Us all have de fine drawers down to de ankle, buttoned with pretty white buttons on de bottom. Lawsy, ma sho\\' cut a mite of drawers, with sewin\\' for her eleven gals and four boys, too. In de summertime we all git a bolt of blue cloth and white tape for trimmin\\', to make Sunday dresses. For de field, all de niggers git homespun what you make jumpers out of. I \\'lect how Marse say, \\'Don\\'t go into de field dirty Monday mornin\\'. Scrub youself and put on de clean jumper.\\' \"Marse sho\\' good to dem gals and bucks what cuttin\\' de cane. When dey git done makin\\' sugar, he give a drink call \\'Peach \\'n Honey\\' to de women folk and whiskey and brandy to de men. And of all de dancin\\' and caperin\\' you ever seen! My pa was fiddler and we\\'d cut de pigeon wing and cut de buck and every other kind of dance. Sometime pa git tired and say he ain\\'t gwineter play no more and us gals git busy and pop him corn and make candy, so to \\'tice him to play more. \"Marse sho\\' turn over in he grave did he know \\'bout some dat \\'lasses. Dem black boys don\\'t care. I seen \\'em pull rats out de sugar barrel and dey taste de sugar and say, \\'Ain\\'t nothin\\' wrong with dat sugar. It still sweet.\\' One day a pert one pull a dead scorpion out de syrup kettle and he jes\\' laugh and say, \\'Marse don\\'t want waste none dis syrup,\\' and he lick de syrup right off dat scorpion\\'s body and legs. \"Lawsy me, I seen thousands and thousands sugar barrels and kettles of syrup in my day. Lawd knows how much cane old Marse have. To dem cuttin\\' de cane it don\\'t seem so much, but to dem what work hour in, hour out, dem sugar cane fields sho\\' stretch from one end de earth to de other. Marse ship hogs and hogs of sugar down de bayou. I seen de river boats go down with big signs what say, \\'Buy dis here \\'lasses\\' on de side. And he raise a world of rice and \\'taters and corn and peanuts, too. \"When de work slight, us black folks sho have de balls and dinners and sech. We git all day to barbecue meat down on de bayou and de white folks come down and eat long side de cullud. \"When a black gal marry, Marse marry her hisself in de big house. He marry \\'em Saturday, so dey git Sunday off, too. One time de river boat come bearin\\' de license for niggers to git marry with. Marse chase \\'em off and say, \\'Don\\'t you come truckin\\' no no-count papers roun\\' my niggers. When I marry \\'em, dey marry as good as if de Lawd God hisself marry \\'em and it don\\'t take no paper to bind de tie.\\' Marse don\\'t stand no messin\\' \\'round, neither. A gal have to be of age and ask her pa and ma and Marse and Missy, and if dey \\'gree, dey go ahead and git marry. Marse have de marry book to put de name down. \"One time Marse take me \\'long to help tote some chillen. He done write up to Virginny for to buy fresh hands. Dey a old man dat hobble \\'long de road and de chillen start to throw rocks and de old man turn \\'round to one prissy one and say, \\'Go on, young\\'un, you\\'ll be where dogs can\\'t bark at you tomorrow. Nex\\' mornin\\' us cookin\\' in de kitchen and all a sudden dat li\\'l boy jes\\' crumple up dead on de floor. Law, we\\'s scairt. Nobody ever bother dat old man no more, for he sho\\' lay de evil finger on you. \"Marse\\'s brother, Conrad, what was a widdyman, come to live on de plantation and he had a li\\'l gal \\'bout eight year old. One day she in de plum orchard playin\\' with a rattlesnake and Marse Conrad have de fit. De li\\'l gal won\\'t let nobody hurt dat snake and she play with him. He won\\'t bite her. She keeps him \\'bout three year, and she\\'d rub and grease him. One day he got sick and dey give him some brandy, but he die and old Doc pickle him in de bottle of brandy. Dat gal git so full of grief dey take her to de infirm\\'ry in New Orleans and den one day she up and die. \"Dat snake ain\\'t all what Doc Fawcett pickle. A slave woman give birth to a baby gal what have two faces with a strip of hair runnin\\' \\'tween. Old Doc Fawcett pickle it in de jar of brandy. Old doc start to court Miss Cornelia when Marse die, but she don\\'t have none of him and he done went straight \\'way and kill hisself. \"One day a li\\'l man come ridin\\' by on a li\\'l dun hoss so fast you couldn\\'t see dat hoss tail a-switchin\\'.

Dey a high old mountain front Marse\\'s house and de Yanks \\'gun pepper cannon ball down from de top dat hill. De war met right dere and dem Yanks and Democrats fit for twenty-four hours straight runnin\\'. \"When de bullets starts rainin\\' down, Marse call us and slip us way back into de woods, where it so black and deep. Next day, when de fight over, Marse come out with great big wagons piles full of mess-poke for us to eat. Dat what us call hog meat. Us sho\\' glad to \\'scape from de Yankees. \"When us driv back to de plantation, sech a sight I never seen. Law, de things I can tell. Dem Yanks have kilt men and women. I seed babies pick up from de road with dere brains bust right out. One old man am drawin\\' water and a cannon ball shoots him right in de well. Dey draws him up with de fishin\\' line. Dey\\'s a old sugar boat out on de bayou with blood and sugar runnin\\' long side de busted barrels. \\'Lasses run in de bayou and blood run in de ditches. Marse have de great big orchard on de road and it wipe clean as de whistle. Bullets wipe up everythin\\' and bust dat sugar cane all to pieces. De house sot far back and \\'scape de bullets, but, law, de time dey have! \"Dey\\'s awful, awful times after dat. A old cotton dress cost five dollars and a pound of coffee cost five dollars and a pint cup flour cost six bits. De Yanks \\'round all de time and one day they comes right in de house where Miss Cornelia eatin\\' her dinner. Dey march \\'round de table, jes\\' scoopin\\' up meat and \\'taters and grabbin\\' cornpone right and left. Miss Cornelia don\\'t say a word, jes\\' smile sweet as honey-cake. I reckon dem sojers might a took de silver and sech only she charm \\'em by bein\\' so quiet and ladylike. First thing you know dem sojers curtsy to Missy and take dereself right out de door and don\\'t come back. \"Den it seem like Marse have all de trouble in de world.

She has lived most of her life within a radius of 60 miles from Houston, and now lives with one of her children in a little house on the highway between Cleveland and Shepherd, Texas. She does not know her age, but appears to be about ninety. \"I\\'s born in Montgomery County and I\\'s the mudder of eleven chillen, four gals and seven boys. My grandma come from Alabama and my daddy was Strawder Green and he belong to Col. Hughes. My maw named Phyllis and she belong to Capt. Pankey. \"There was \\'bout forty niggers, big and little, on the plantation. Lawd, they was good to us. Us didn\\' know nothin\\' \\'bout bad times and cutting and whipping and slashing. I had to work in the house and I \\'member one thing I has to do was scrub Mistus\\' gol\\' snuffbox twict a week. She kep\\' sweet, Scotch snuff and sometimes I takes a pinch out. \"We used to go to the white folks church and if us couldn\\' git in we\\'d stand round by the door and sing. Mistus wouldn\\' \\'low us dance on the place but they give us pass to go to dance on nex\\' plantation, where my daddy live. \"Every year they have big Christmas dinner and ham and turkey and allus feed us good. Us have Christmas party and sing songs. That was sweet music. \"Marster have a lovely house, all ceiled and plastered. It was a log house but it was make all beautiful inside with mirrors and on the board was lots of silver and china and silver spoons with the gol\\' linin\\'s and part of my job was to keep \\'em sparklin\\'. \"Folks in them times cooks in the fireplace and my auntie, she cook. She make \\'simmon bread and \\'tater pone and the like. She mash up \\'simmons with butter and pour sweet milk and flour in it. That make good \\'simmon bread. We has skillets what was flat and deep and set on three legs. \"The slaves lived in little log houses and sleep on wood beds. The beds was make three-legged. They make augur hole in side of the house and put in pieces of wood to make the bed frame, and they put straw and cotton mattress on them bed. \"Old marster used to let he slaves have a extry cotton patch to theyselves and they work it by the moonlight. They could sell that cotton and have the money for theyselves. \"My white mistus was a Christian and she\\'d own her God anywhere. She used to shout, jus\\' sit and clap her hands and say, \\'Hallalujah.\\' Once I seed her shout in church and I thinks something ail her and I run down the aisle and goes to fannin\\' her. \"One of the slaves was a sort-a preacher and sometimes marster \\'lowed him to preach to the niggers, but he have to preach with a tub over his head, \\'cause he git so happy he talk too loud. Somebody from the big house liable to come down and make him quit \\'cause he makin\\' \\'sturbance. \"I brings water from the well and they have what they call piggins, and they was little tubs with two handles.

She had a little gal git water and help. She never had no chillen of her own. I\\'d blow the horn for the mudders of the little babies to come in from the fields and nurse \\'em, in mornin\\' and afternoon. Mistus feed them what was old enough to eat victuals. Sometimes, they mammies take them to the field and fix pallet on ground for them to lay on. \"The las\\' word my old Mistus Pankey say when she die was, \\'You take care of Charlette.\\' 420249 [Illustration: Francis Black] FRANCIS BLACK was born at Grand Bluff, Mississippi, about 1850, on the Jim Carlton plantation. When five years old, she was stolen and taken to the slave market in New Orleans. Failing to sell her there, the slave traders took her to Jefferson, Texas, and sold her to Bill Tumlin. Francis stayed with him five years after she was freed, then married and moved to Cass County, Texas. She became blind a year ago, and now lives at the Bagland Old Folks Home, 313 Elm St., Texarkana, Texas. \"My name am Francis Black, and I don\\'t know jes\\' how old I is, but \\'members lots \\'bout them slave days. I was a big gal, washin\\' and ironin\\', when they sot the darkies free. From that, I cal\\'late I\\'m in my eighties. \"I was born in Grand Bluff, in Mississippi, on Old Man Carlton\\'s plantation, and I was stole from my folks when I was a li\\'l gal and never seed them no more. Us kids played in the big road there in Mississippi, and one day me and \\'nother gal is playin\\' up and down the road and three white men come \\'long in a wagon. They grabs us up and puts us in the wagon and covers us with quilts.

His father was a Frenchman and Olivier speaks rather haltingly, as though it is difficult for him to express his thoughts in English, for he has talked a species of French all his life. He lives in Beaumont, Texas. \"I was plowing and hoeing before the freedom and I talk more of the French \\'cause I comes from St. Martinville Parish. I was born there in Louisiana and my mama was Angeline Jean Pierre and she was slave born. My papa was Olivier Blanchard and he white man carpenter on old plantation. We belong to Clairville La San and all live on that place. My papa just plain carpenter but could draw patterns for houses. I don\\'t know where he larn that work. \"I was count freeborn and still have one white half sister alive. When freedom come my mama and papa split up and mama get marry. \"I pick cotton and mama cook. She make koosh-koosh and cyayah--that last plain clabber. Mama cook lots of gaspergou and carp and the poisson ami fish, with the long snout--what they call gar now. I think it eel fish they strip the skin off and wrap round the hair and make it curly. \"The Bayou Teche, it run close by and the women do all the clothes with a big paddle with holes in it to clean them in the bayou. They paddle them clean on the rocks and then wash them in the water. \"One time one big bayou \\'gator come up and bite a woman\\'s arm off. She my sister in law. But they keep on washing the clothes in the bayou just the same. \"We have plenty to eat and peaches and muscadines and pecans, \\'cause there right smart woods and swamp there. We play in the woods and most time in the bayou on boats with planks what would float. We had the good time and had a little pet coon. You know, the coon like sweet things and he steal our syrup and when we chase him with the switch he hide under the bed. \"My old missus was good Catholic and she have us christened and make the first communion. That not registered, \\'cause it before the freedom, but it were in old St. Martin\\'s church, same old church what stand now. There was a statue of Pere Jean, the old priest, in front the church and one of St. Martin, too. \"Plenty men from St. Martinville go to the war and Archie DeBlieu, he go to Virginia and fight. The first one to pass our place was John Well Banks and he was a Yankee going up the Red River. \"The yellow fever came durin\\' that war and kill lots. All the big plantation have the graveyard for the cullud people. That fever so bad they get the coffin ready before they dead and they so scared that some weren\\'t dead but they think they are and bury them. There was a white girl call Colene Sonnier what was to marry Sunday and she take sick Friday before. She say not to bury her in the ground but they put her there while they got the tomb ready. When they open the ground grave to put her in the tomb they find she buried alive and she eat all her own shoulder and hand away. Her sweetheart, Gart Berrild, he see that corpse, and he go home and get took with yellow fever and die. \"They was the old lady what die. She was a terrible soul. One time after she die I go to get water out of her rain barrel and I had a lamp in one hand. That old lady\\'s ghost blowed out the lamp and slapped the pitcher out my hand. After she first die her husband put black dress on her and tie up the jaw with a rag and my girl look in the room and there that old lady, Liza Lee, sittin\\' by the fire. My girl tell her mama and after three day she go back, and Liza Lee buried but my wife see her sittin\\' by the fire. Then she sorry she whip the chile for sayin\\' she saw Liza Lee. That old lady, Liza Lee, was a tart and she stay a tart for a long time. \"I marry 72 year ago in the Catholic Church in St. Martinville. My wife call Adeline Chretien and she dead 37 year. We have seven children but four live now. Frank my only boy live now, in Iowa, in Louisiana, and my two girls live, Enziede De Querive and Rose Baptiste. 420199 JULIA BLANKS was born of a slave mother and a three-quarter Indian father, in San Antonio, in the second year of the Civil War. Her mother, part French and part Negro, was owned by Mrs. John G. Wilcox, formerly a Miss Donaldson, who had lived at the White House, and who gave Julia to her daughter. After the slaves were freed, Julia continued to live with her mother in San Antonio until, at fifteen, she married Henry Hall. Five years later her second marriage took place, at Leon Springs, Texas, where she lived until moving to the Adams ranch, on the Frio River. Here she raised her family. After leaving the Adams ranch, Julia and Henry bought two sections of state land, but after four years they let it go back because of Henry\\'s ill health, and moved to Uvalde. \"I was born in San Antonio, in 1862. My mother\\'s name was Rachael Miller. I don\\'t know if she was born in Tennessee or Mississippi. I heard her talk of both places. I don\\'t know nothing about my father, because he run off when I was about three months old. He was three-quarter Cherokee Indian. They were lots of Indians then, and my husband\\'s people come from Savannah, Georgia, and he said they was lots of Indians there. I had two sisters and one brother and the sisters are dead but my brother lives somewhere in Arizona. My mother\\'s master\\'s name was John C. Wilcox. \"When we was small chillen, they hired my sisters out, but not me. My grandfather bought my grandmother\\'s time and they run a laundry house. They hired my mother out, too. \"You see, my grandmother was free born, but they stole her and sold her to Miss Donaldson. She was half French. She looked jes\\' like a French woman. She wasn\\'t a slave, but she and her brother were stolen and sold. She said the stage coach used to pass her aunt\\'s house, and one day she and her brother went down to town to buy some buns, and when they were comin\\' back, the stage stopped and asked \\'em to ride. She wanted to ride, but her brother didn\\'t. But they kep\\' coaxin\\' \\'em till they got \\'em in. They set her down between the two women that was in there and set her brother between two men, and when they got close to the house, they threw cloaks over their heads and told the driver to drive as fast as he could, and he sure drove. They taken \\'em to Washin\\'ton, to the White House, and made her a present to Mary Wilcox (Miss Donaldson) and her brother to somebody else. Then this woman married John C. Wilcox and they come to Texas. \"She saw a cousin of hers when they got to Washin\\'ton, and she knew, after that, he had somethin\\' to do with her and her brother bein\\' stolen. One day she found a piece of yellow money and took it to her cousin and he told her it wasn\\'t no good and gave her a dime to go get her some candy. After that, she saw gold money and knew what it was. \"She said she had a good time, though, when she was growing up. They were pretty good to her, but after they came to San Antonio, Mrs. Wilcox began bein\\' mean. She kep\\' my mother hired out all the time and gave me to her daughter and my sister to her son. My mother was kep\\' hired out all the time, cooking; and after freedom, she just took to washin\\' and ironin\\'. My grandfather bought his time and my grandmother\\'s time out. They didn\\'t stay with her. \"I\\'ve heard my mother talk about coffee. They roasted beans and made coffee. She says, out on the plantation, they would take bran and put it in a tub and have \\'em stir it up with water in it and let all the white go to the bottom and dip it off and strain it and make starch. I have made starch out of flour over and often, myself. I had four or five little girls; and I had to keep \\'em like pins. In them days they wore little calico dresses, wide and full and standin\\' out, and a bonnet to match every dress. \"I used to hear my grandmother tell about the good times they used to have. They would go from one plantation to another and have quiltin\\'s and corn huskin\\'s. And they would dance. They didn\\'t have dances then like they do now. The white people would give them things to eat. They would have to hoof it five or six miles and didn\\'t mind it. \"They had what they called _patros_, and if you didn\\'t have a pass they would whip you and put you in jail. Old Man Burns was hired at the courthouse, and if the marsters had slaves that they didn\\'t want to whip, they would send them to the courthouse to be whipped. Some of the marsters was good and some wasn\\'t. There was a woman, oh, she was the meanest thing! I don\\'t know if she had a husband--I never did hear anything about him. When she would get mad at one of her slave women, she would make the men tie her down, and she had what they called cat-o\\'-nine-tails, and after she got the blood to come, she would dip it in salt and pepper and whip her again. Oh, she was mean! My mother\\'s marster was good; he wouldn\\'t whip any of his slaves. But his wife wasn\\'t good. If she got mad at the women, when he would come home she would say: \\'John, I want you to whip Liza.\\' Or Martha. And he would say, \\'Them are your slaves. You whip them.\\' He was good and she was mean. \"When my aunt would go to clean house, she (Mrs. Wilcox) would turn all the pictures in the house but one, the meanest looking one--you know how it always looks like a picture is watching you everywhere you go--and she would tell her if she touched a thing or left a bit of dirt or if she didn\\'t do it good, this picture would tell. And she believed it. \"My grandmother told a tale one time. You know in slave time they had an old woman to cook for the chillen. One day they were going to have company. This woman that was the boss of the place where the chillen was kept told the old cullud woman to take a piece of bacon and grease the mouths of all the chillen. Then she told a boy to bring them up to these people, and the woman said: \\'Oh, you must feed these chillen good, just look at their mouths!\\' And the woman said, \\'Oh, that\\'s the way they eat.\\' They didn\\'t get meat often. That was just to make them believe they had lots to eat. \"No. They were cut off from education. The way my stepfather got his learning was a cullud blacksmith would teach school at night, and us chillen taught our mother. She didn\\'t know how to spell or read or nothin\\'. She didn\\'t know B from bull\\'s foot. Some of them were allowed to have church and some didn\\'t. Mighty few read the Bible \\'cause they couldn\\'t read. As my mother used to say, they were raised up as green as cucumbers. That old blacksmith was the onlyist man that knew how to read and write in slavery time that I knew of. My grandmother or none of them knew how to read; they could count, but that was all. That\\'s what makes me mad. I tell my grandchillen they ought to learn all they can \\'cause the old people never had a chance. My husband never did have any schooling, but he sure could figger. Now, if you want me to get tangled up, just give me a pencil and paper and I don\\'t know nothing.\" She tapped her skull. \"I figger in my head! The chillen, today, ought to appreciate an education. \"Oh, yes, they were good to the slaves when they were sick. They would have the doctor come out and wait on them. Most plantations had what they called an old granny cullud woman that treated the chillen with herbs and such things. \"Games? I don\\'t know. We used to play rap jacket. We would get switches and whip one another. You know, after you was hit several times it didn\\'t hurt much. I\\'ve played a many time. In slave time the men used to go huntin\\' at night, and hunt \\'possums and \\'coons. They would have a dog or two along. They used to go six or seven miles afoot to corn huskin\\'s and quiltin\\'s. And those off the other plantations would come over and join in the work. And they would nearly always have a good dinner. Sometimes some of the owners would give \\'em a hog or somethin\\' nice to eat, but some of \\'em didn\\'t. \"No\\'m, I don\\'t know if they run off to the North, but some of them runned off and stayed in the swamps, and they was mean. They called them runaways. If they saw you, they would tell you to bring them something to eat. And if you didn\\'t do it, if they ever got you they sure would fix you. \"I don\\'t know when my mother was set free. My husband\\'s marster\\'s name was King. He was from Savannah, Georgia, but at the time was living close to Boerne. My husband\\'s father was killed in the war. When my husband was about ten years old, his marster hadn\\'t told them they was free. You know some of them didn\\'t tell the slaves they was free until they had to. After freedom was declared, lots of people didn\\'t tell the slaves they were free. One morning, my husband said, he happended to look out and he saw a big bunch of men coming down the road, and he thought he never saw such pretty men in his life on them horses. They had so many brass buttons on their clothes it looked like gold. So he run and told his mama, and she looked and saw it was soldiers, and some of \\'em told the boss, and he looked and saw them soldiers comin\\' in the big gate and he called \\'em in quick, and told them they were free. So when the soldiers come, they asked him if he had told his slaves they were free, and he said yes. They asked the Negroes if they lived there, and they said yes. One said, \\'He just told us we was free.\\' The soldiers asked him why he had just told them, and he said they wasn\\'t all there and he was waiting for them all to be there. \"My husband said he thought them was the prettiest bunch of men he ever saw, and the prettiest horses. Of course, he hadn\\'t never saw any soldiers before. I know it looked pretty to me when I used to see the soldiers at the barracks and hear the band playin\\' and see them drillin\\' and ever\\'thing. You see, we lived on a little cross-street right back of St. Mary\\'s Church in San Antonio, I don\\'t know how that place is now. Where the post office is now, there used to be a blacksmith shop and my father worked there. I went back to San Antonio about fifteen years ago and jes\\' took it afoot and looked at the changes. \"I was fifteen years old the first time I married. It was almost a run-a-way marriage. I was married in San Antonio. My first husband\\'s name was Henry Hall. My first wedding dress was as wide as a wagon sheet. It was white lawn, full of tucks, and had a big ruffle at the bottom. I had a wreath and a veil, too. The veil had lace all around it. We danced and had a supper. We danced all the dances they danced then; the waltz, square, quadrille, polka, and the gallopade--and that\\'s what it was, all right; you shore galloped. You\\'d start from one end of the hall and run clear to the other end. In those days, the women with all them long trains--the man would hold it over his arm. No, Lord! Honeymoons wasn\\'t thought of then. No\\'m, I never worked out a day in my life.\" Jokingly, \"I guess they thought I was too good looking. I was about twenty years old when I married the second time. I was married in Leon Springs the second time. \"Before we come out to this country from Leon Springs, they was wild grapes, dewberries, plums and agaritas, black haws, red haws. M-m-m! Them dewberries, I dearly love \\'em! I never did see wild cherries out here. I didn\\'t like the cherries much, but they make fine wine. We used to gather mustang grapes and make a barrel of wine. \"After I married the second time, we lived on the Adams ranch on the Frio and stayed on that ranch fifteen years. We raised all our chillen right on that ranch. I am taken for a Mexkin very often. I jes\\' talk Mexkin back to \\'em. I learned to talk it on the ranch. As long as I have lived at this place, I have never had a cross word about the chillen. All my neighbors here is Mexkins. They used to laugh at me when I tried to talk to the hands on the ranch, but I learned to talk like \\'em. \"We used to have big round-ups out on the Adams ranch. They had fences then. The neighbors would all come over and get out and gather the cattle and bring \\'em in. Up at Leon Springs at that time they didn\\'t have any fences, and they would have big round-ups there. But after we come out here, it was different. He would notify his neighbors they were goin\\' to gather cattle on a certain day. The chuck wagon was right there at the ranch, that is, _I_ was the chuck wagon. But if they were goin\\' to take the cattle off, they would have a chuck wagon. They would round up a pasture at a time and come in to the ranch for their meals. Now on the Wallace ranch, they would always take a chuck wagon. When they were gettin\\' ready to start brandin\\' at the ranch, my husband always kep\\' his brandin\\' irons all in the house, hangin\\' up right where he could get his hands on \\'em. Whenever they would go off to other ranches to gather cattle, you would see ever\\' man with his beddin\\' tied up behind him on his horse. He\\'d have jes\\' a small roll. They would always have a slicker if nothin\\' else. That slicker answered for ever\\'thing sometimes. My husband slep\\' many a night with his saddle under his head. \"He used to carry mail from San Antonio to Dog Town, horseback. That was the town they used to call Lodi (Lodo), but I don\\'t know how to spell it, and don\\'t know what it means. It was a pretty tough town. The jail house was made out of \\'dobe and pickets. They had a big picket fence all around it. They had a ferry that went right across the San Antonio River from Floresville to Dog Town. I know he told me he come to a place and they had a big sign that said, \\'Nigga, don\\'t let the sun go down on you here.\\' They was awful bad down in there. He would leave Dog Town in the evenin\\' and he would get to a certain place up toward San Antonio to camp, and once he stopped before he got to the place he always camped at. He said he didn\\'t know what made \\'im stop there that time, but he stopped and took the saddle off his horse and let \\'im graze while he lay down. After a while, he saw two cigarette fires in the dark right up the road a little piece, and he heard a Mexkin say, \\'I don\\'t see why he\\'s so late tonight. He always gets here before night and camps right there.\\' He knew they was waylayin\\' \\'im, so he picked his saddle up right easy and carried it fu\\'ther back down the road in the brush and then come got his horse and took him out there and saddled \\'im up and went away \\'round them Mexkins. He went on in to San Antonio and didn\\'t go back any more. A white man took the mail to carry then and the first trip he made, he never come back. He went down with the mail and they found the mail scattered somewhere on the road, but they never found the man, or the horse, either. \"On the Adams ranch, in the early days, we used to have to pack water up the bank. You might not believe it, but one of these sixty-pound lard cans full of water, I\\'ve a-carried it on my head many a time. We had steps cut into the bank, and it was a good ways down to the water, and I\\'d pack that can up to the first level and go back and get a couple a buckets of water, and carry a bucket in each hand and the can on my head up the next little slantin\\' hill before I got to level ground. I carried water that way till my chillen got big enough to carry water, then they took it up. When I was carryin\\' water in them big cans my head would sound like new leather--you know how it squeaks, and that was the way it sounded in my head. But, it never did hurt me. You see, the Mexkins carry loads on their heads, but they fix a rag around their heads some way to help balance it. But I never did. I jes\\' set it up on my head and carried it that way. Oh, we used to carry water! My goodness! My mother said it was the Indian in me--the way I could carry water. \"When we were first married and moved to the Adams ranch, we used to come here to Uvalde to dances. They had square dances then. They hadn\\'t commenced all these frolicky dances they have now. They would have a supper, but they had it to sell. Every fellow would have to treat his girl he danced with. \"I can remember when my grandfather lived in a house with a dirt floor, and they had a fireplace. And I can remember just as well how he used to bake hoecakes for us kids. He would rake back the coals and ashes real smooth and put a wet paper down on that and then lay his hoecake down on the paper and put another paper on top of that and the ashes on top. I used to think that was the best bread I ever ate. I tried it a few times, but I made such a mess I didn\\'t try it any more. One thing I have seen \\'em make, especially on the ranch. You take and clean a stick and you put on a piece of meat and piece of fat till you take and use up the heart and liver and sweetbread and other meat and put it on the stick and wrap it around with leaf fat and then put the milk gut, or marrow gut, around the whole thing. They call that _macho_ (mule), and I tell you, it\\'s good. They make it out of a goat and sheep, mostly. \"Another thing, we used to have big round-ups, and I have cooked great pans of steak and mountain orshters. Generally, at the brandin\\' and markin\\', I cooked up many a big pan of mountain orshters. I wish I had a nickel for ever\\' one I\\'ve cooked, and ate too! People from up North have come down there, and, when they were brandin\\' and cuttin\\' calves there, they sure did eat and enjoy that dinner. \"The men used to go up to the lake, fishin\\', and catch big trout, or bass, they call \\'em now; and we\\'d take big buckets of butter--we didn\\'t take a saucer of butter or a pound; we taken butter up there in buckets, for we sure had plenty of it--and we\\'d take lard too, and cook our fish up there, and had corn bread or hoe cakes and plenty of butter for ever\\'thing, and it sure was good. I tell you--like my husband used to say--we was livin\\' ten days in the week, then. \"When we killed hogs, the meat from last winter was hung outside and then new meat, salted down and then smoked, put in there, and we would cook the old bacon for the dogs. We always kep\\' some good dogs there, and anybody\\'ll tell you they was always fat. We had lots of wild turkeys and I raised turkeys, too, till I got sick of cookin\\' turkeys. Don\\'t talk about deer! You know, it wasn\\'t then like it is now. You could go kill venison any time you wanted to. But I don\\'t blame \\'em for passin\\' that law, for people used to go kill \\'em and jes\\' take out the hams and tenderloin and leave the other layin\\' there. I have saved many a sack of dried meat to keep it from spoilin\\'. \"We would raise watermelons, too. We had a big field three mile from the house and a ninety-acre field right in the house. We used to go get loads of melons for the hogs and they got to where they didn\\'t eat anything but the heart. \"I used to leave my babies at the house with the older girl and go out horseback with my husband. My oldest girl used to take the place of a cowboy, and put her hair up in her hat. And ride! My goodness, she loved to ride! They thought she was a boy. She wore pants and leggin\\'s. And maybe you think she couldn\\'t ride! \"After we left that ranch, we took up some state land. I couldn\\'t tell you how big that place was. We had 640 in one place and 640 in another place; it was a good big place. After my husband got sick, we had to let it go back. We couldn\\'t pay it out. We only lived on it about four years. \"My husband has been dead about nineteen years. I had a pen full and a half of chillen. I have four livin\\' chillen, two girls and two boys. I have a girl, Carrie, in California, workin\\' in the fruit all the time; one boy, George, in Arizona, workin\\' in the mines; and a girl in Arizona, Lavinia, washes and irons and cooks and ever\\'thing else she can get at. And I have one boy here. I have ten grandchillen and I\\'ve got five great grandchillen. \"I belong to the Methodist Church. I joined about twenty-five years ago. My husband joined with me. But here, of late years, when I go to church, it makes me mad to see how the people do the preacher up there trying to do all the good he can do and them settin\\' back there laughin\\' and talkin\\'. I was baptized. There was about five or six of us baptized in the Leona down here. \"People tell that I\\'ve got plenty and don\\'t need help. Even the Mexkins here and ever\\'body say I\\'ve got money. Jes\\' because we had that farm down there they think I come out with money. But what in the world would I want with money if I didn\\'t use it? I can\\'t take it with me when I die and I could be gettin\\' the use of it now while I need it. I could have what I want to eat, anyway. I\\'m gettin\\' a little pension, but it ain\\'t near enough to keep us. I\\'ve got these two grandchillen here, and things is so high, too, so I don\\'t have enough of anything without skimpin\\' all the time. 420312 ELVIRA BOLES, 94, has outlived nine of her ten children. She lives at 3109 Manzana St., El Paso, Texas, with her daughter, Minnie. She was born a slave of the Levi Ray family near Lexington, Mississippi, and was sold as a child to Elihn Boles, a neighboring plantation owner. During the last year of the Civil War she was brought to Texas, with other refugee slaves. \"I jus\\' \\'member my first marster and missus, \\'cause she don\\' want me there. I\\'se a child of the marster. Dey didn\\' tell me how old I was when dey sold me to Boles. My missus sold me to Boles. Dey tuk us to where dere was a heap of white folks down by the court house and we\\'d be there in lots and den de whites \\'ud bid for us. I don\\' know how old I was, but I washed dishes and den dey put me to work in de fields. We don\\' git a nickel in slavery. \"Marster Boles didn\\' have many slaves on de farm, but lots in brickyard. I toted brick back and put \\'em down where dey had to be. Six bricks each load all day. That\\'s de reason I ain\\'t no \\'count, I\\'se worked to death. I fired de furnace for three years. Stan\\'in\\' front wid hot fire on my face. Hard work, but God was wid me. We\\'d work \\'till dark, quit awhile after sundown. Marster was good to slaves, didn\\' believe in jus\\' lashin\\' \\'em. He\\'d not be brutal but he\\'d kill \\'em dead right on the spot. Overseers \\'ud git after \\'em and whop \\'em down. \"I\\'se seventeen, maybe, when I married to slave of Boles. Married on Saturday night. Dey give me a dress and dey had things to eat, let me have something like what you call a party. We just had common clothes on. And then I had to work every day. I\\'d leave my baby cryin\\' in de yard and he\\'d be cryin\\', but I couldn\\' stay. Done everything but split rails. I\\'ve cut timber and ploughed. Done everything a man could do. I couldn\\' notice de time, but I\\'d be glad to git back to my baby. \"Log cabins had dirt floor, sometimes plankin\\' down. I worked late and made pretty quilts. Sometimes dey\\'d let us have a party. Saturday nights, de white people give us meat and stuff. Give us syrup and we\\'d make candy, out in de yard. We\\'d ask our frien\\'s and dance all night. Den go to work next day. We\\'d clean off de yard and dance out dere. Christmas come, dey give us a big eggnog and give us cake. Our white folks did. White folks chillen had bought candy. We didn\\' git any, but dey let us play wid de white chillen. We\\'d play smut. Whoever beat wid de cards, he\\'d git to smut you. Take de smut from fireplace and rub on your face. \"Doctor take care of us iffen we sick, so\\'s git us well to git us to work. \"Iffen dey had a pretty girl dey would take \\'em, and I\\'se one of \\'em, and my oldest child, he boy by Boles, almost white. \"We had to steal away at night to have church on de ditch bank, and crawl home on de belly. Once overseers heered us prayin\\', give us one day each 100 lashes. \"Den when de Yankees come through, dey \\'ud be good to de slaves, to keep \\'em from tellin\\' on \\'em. Freedom was give Jan. 1, 1865, but de slaves didn\\' know it \\'till June 19. We\\'se refugees. Boles, our marster, sent us out and we come from Holmes County to Cherokee County in a wagon. We was a dodgin\\' in and out, runnin\\' from de Yankees. Marster said dey was runnin\\' us from de Yankees to keep us, but we was free and didn\\' know it. I lost my baby, its buried somewhere on dat road. Died at Red River and we left it. De white folks go out and buy food \\'long de road and hide us. Dey say we\\'d never be free iffen dey could git to Texas wid us, but de people in Texas tol\\' us we\\'s free. Den marster turn us loose in de world, without a penny. Oh, dey was awful times. We jus\\' worked from place to place after freedom. \"When we started from Mississippi, dey tol\\' us de Yankees \\'ud kill us iffen dey foun\\' us, and dey say, \\'You ain\\'t got no time to take nothin\\' to whar you goin\\'. Take your little bundle and leave all you has in your house.\\' So when we got to Texas I jus\\' had one dress, what I had on. Dat\\'s de way all de cullud people was after freedom, never had nothin\\' but what had on de back. Some of dem had right smart in dere cabins, but they was skeered and dey lef\\' everything. Bed clothes and all you had was lef\\'. We didn\\' know any better den.\" 420102 [Illustration: Betty Bormer (Bonner)] BETTY BORMER, 80, was born a slave to Col. M.T. Johnson, who farmed at Johnson Station in Tarrant County. He owned Betty\\'s parents, five sisters and four brothers, in addition to about 75 other slaves. After the family was freed, they moved with the other slaves to a piece of land Col. Johnson allowed them the use of until his death. Betty lives in a negro settlement at Stop Six, a suburb of Fort Worth. \"I\\'se bo\\'n April 4th, in 1857, at Johnson Station. It was named after my marster. He had a big farm, I\\'se don\\' know how many acres. He had seven chillen; three boys, Ben, Tom and Mart, and four girls, Elizabeth, Sally, Roddy and Veanna. \"Marster Johnson was good to us cullud folks and he feeds us good.

De girls larned my auntie how to play de piano. \"Dere am lots of music on dat place; fiddle, banjo and de piano.

He sho\\' do dat, too, \\'cause de niggers goes to him lots of times and he always helps. \"Marster says dat he needs help on de place and sich dat stays, he\\'d pay \\'em for de work. Lots of dem stayed, but some left. To dem dat leaves, marster gives a mule, or cow and sich for de start. To my folks, marster gives some land.

Boyd remained with his master for four years after emancipation, then moved to Harrison County, where he now lives. His memory is poor, but he managed to recall a few incidents. \"I was fifteen years when they says we\\'re free. That\\'s the age my Old Missy done give me when the war stopped. She had all us niggers\\' ages in a book, and told me I was born near Henderson. My Old Marse was Wash Trammel and he brunged me and my mama and papa from Alabama. Mama was named Juliet and papa, Amos. Marse Trammel owned my grandpa and grandma, too, and they was named Jeanette and Josh. \"The plantation was two made into one, and plenty big, and more\\'n a hundred slaves to work it. Marse lived in a hewed log house, weather-boarded out and in, and the quarters was good, log houses with bed railin\\'s hewed out of logs. We raised everything we et, \\'cept sugar, and Marse bought that in big hogsheads. We got our week\\'s rations every Sunday, and when we went to eat, everybody\\'s part was put out to them on a tin plate. \"Marse Trammel give a big cornshucking every fall. He had two bottom fields in corn. First we\\'d gather peas and cushaws and pumpkins out the corn field, then get the corn and pile it front the cribs. They was two big cribs for the corn we kep\\' to use and five big cribs for sale corn. My uncle stayed round the sale corn cribs all spring, till ginnin\\' time, \\'cause folks come for miles after corn. Marse had five wheat cribs and one rye crib. We went ten mile to Tatum to git our meal and flour ground. \"The patterrollers darsn\\'t come \\'bout our place or bother us niggers. Marse Wash allus say, \\'I\\'ll patterroller my own place.\\' Marse was good to us and only once a overseer beat a woman up a trifle, and Marse Trammel fired him that same day. \"The sojers \\'fiscated lots of corn from Marse and some more owners in Rusk County piled corn up in a big heap and made me go mind it till the rest the sojers got there. I was settin\\' top that corn pile, me and my big bulldog, and the General rode up. My dog growled and I made him hush. The General man say to me, \\'Boy, you is \\'scused now, go on home.\\' I got to a fence and looked back, and that General was hewin\\' him a hoss trough out a log. The sojers come in droves and set up they camp. I sot on a stump and watched them pass. They stayed three, four days till the corn was all fed up. \"While they\\'s camped there they\\'d cotch chickens. They had a fishin\\' pole and line and hook. They\\'d put a grain of corn on the hook and ride on they hoss and pitch the hook out \\'mong the chickens. When a chicken swallowed the corn they\\'d jerk up the line with that chicken and ride off. \"Marse had six hundred bales cotton in the Shreveport warehouse when war was over. He got word them Yankees done take it on a boat. He got his brother to take him to Shreveport and say, \\'I\\'ll follow that cotton to Hell and back.\\' He followed his cotton to Alabama and got it back, but he died and was buried there in Alabama \\'fore Old Missy knowed it. \"I stayed with her four years after surrender and then went to farmin\\' with my folks, for $10.00 a month. After a year or two I went to railroadin\\', helping cut the right-of-way for the T.& P. Railroad, from Marshall to Longview. They paid us $1.50 the day and three drinks of whiskey a day. \"I marries four times but had only one child, but I never done nothin\\' \\'citin\\'. I lives by myself now, and gits $11.00 pension to eat on. 420074 [Illustration: Issabella Boyd] ISSABELLA BOYD was born a slave of Gus Wood, in Richmond, Va., who moved to Texas by boat before the Civil War. Isabella still lives in Beaumont. \"Lemme see, I come from Richmond, Virginy, to Texas. Massa Gus Wood was my owner and I kin recollect my white folks. I\\'s born in dat country and dey brought me over to Richmond and my papa and mama, too. I was jus\\' \\'bout big \\'nough to begin to \\'member. \"I come from Richmond yere on de boat, sometime de steamboat, sometime de big boat. When we left New Orleans dat evenin\\' we struck a big storm. Us git on dat boat in Richmond and went floatin\\' down to de big boat dat mornin\\'. Looks like it jus\\' fun for us, but every time we look back and think \\'bout home it make us sad. \"I had a dear, good mistus and my boss man, he furnish a house for he servants, a purty good house. And dey had a place for de Sunday School. Dem was good times. De mistus cook dinner and send it down for de old folks and chillen to have plenty. \"My mistus kep\\' me right in de house, right by her, sewing. I could sew so fast I git my task over \\'fore de others git started good. \"Lots of times when de gals wants to go to de dance I he\\'p make de dresses.

A man named Sanford Wooldrige stole him and brought him to Texas, somewhere near Waco. James does not know his age, but thinks he is a hundred years or more old. He now lives in Itasca, Texas. \"I\\'s born in dat Phantom Valley, in de Indian Territory, what am now call Oklahoma. Us live in a Indian hut. My pappy Blue Bull Bird and mammy Nancy Will.

He was born a slave to John Thomas Boykin, Troupe Co., Georgia, 80 miles from Lagrange, Ga. His master was a very wealthy plantation owner, working 1,000 slaves. \"I been well taken care of durin\\' my life. When I was young I lived right in de big house with my marster. I was houseboy. My mother\\'s name was Betsy Ann Boykin and she was cook for Old Missus. My grandpa was blacksmith. I slept on a pallet in de kitchen and in winter time on cold nights I \\'members how cold I would get. I\\'d wake up and slip in by marsters bed and den I\\'d say, \\'Marster John, I\\'s about to freeze.\\' He\\'d say, \\'You ought to freeze, you little black devil. What you standin\\' dere for?\\' I\\'d say, \\'Please, marster John, jes\\' let me crawl in by your feet.\\' He\\'d say, \\'Well, I will dis one time,\\' and dat\\'s de way I\\'d do every cold night. \"I was full of mischief and I\\'d tu\\'n de mules out of de lot, jus\\' to see de stableboy git a lickin\\'. One time I wanted a fiddle a white man named Cocoanut Harper kep\\' tryin\\' to sell me for $7.50. I didn\\' never have any money, \\'cept a little the missie give me, so I kep\\' teasin\\' her to buy de fiddle for me. She was allus on my side, so she tol\\' me to take some co\\'n from de crib and trade in for de fiddle. In de night I slips out and hitch up de mules and fetched de co\\'n to old Harper\\'s house and traded for dat fiddle. Den I hides out and play it, so\\'s marster wouldn\\' fin\\' out, but he did and he whip all de daylight outta me. When de missie try to whip me, I jes\\' wrop up in her big skirts and she never could hurt me much. \"I allus ate my meals in de house at de white folks table, after dey done et. Iffen I couldn\\' sit in de marster\\'s chair, I\\'d swell up like a toad. \"De marster done all de whippin\\', \\'cause dey had been two overseers killed on de plantation for whippin\\' slaves till de blood run out dey body. \"Was I bovered with haints and spooks? I been meetin\\' up with \\'em all my life. When I was younger I was such an old scratch I\\'d meet \\'em right in de road, some without heads. I\\'d take to my heels and then I\\'d stop and look \\'round and they\\'d be gone. \"I wore home-weaved shirts till I was grown, then I had some pants and dey was homemade, too. The women gathered womack leaves to dye de goods black. \"I well rec\\'lects when my marster went to war. He called all us in de kitchen and telled us he had to go over dere and whip those sons-of-bitches and would be back \\'fore breakfast. He didn\\' return for two years. I says, \\'Marster, we sho\\' would have waited breakfast on you a long time.\\' He said, \\'Yes; deys de hardes\\' sons-of-bitches to whip I ever had dealins\\' with.\\' \"When war was over, he called us together and tol\\' us we were free. He said, \\'Now, I\\'m goin\\' to give you a big day and after that you can stay and work for pay or you can go.\\' So he rolled out two barrels of whiskey and killed hogs and spread a big day. \"I wants to tell you \\'bout how we killed hogs in my day. We digged a deep pit in de groun\\' and heated big rocks red hot and filled up de pit with water and dropped dem hot rocks in and got de water hot; den we stuck de hogs and rolled \\'em in dat pit. \"Soon after I\\'s free a man come for me from Louisville to hire me as foreman in his cotton mule barn. So I went there and I worked in Kentucky for 18 year. Fifty-one years ago I married my ol\\' woman, Rachel Taylor, at Corsicana, Texas, and I think she\\'s jes\\' as fine as the day I married her. We has six chillen and all works hard for a livin\\' and we got one lil\\' grandbaby 10 years ol\\'. She lives here at our house and we\\'re educatin\\' her. \"I knows I\\'s goin\\' to live to be over 100 years ol\\', \\'cause my marster done tol\\' me so.\" 420073 [Illustration: Monroe Brackins] MONROE BRACKINS, born in Monroe Co., Mississippi, in 1853, was the property of George Reedes. He was brought to Medina County, Texas, when two years old. Monroe learned to snare and break mustangs and became a cowpuncher. He lives in Hondo, Texas. He has an air of pride and self-respect, and explained that he used little dialect because he learned to talk from the \"white folks\" as he was growing up. \"I was bo\\'n in Mississippi, Monroe County. I\\'m 84 years old. My master, George Reedes, brought me, my father and mother and my two sisters to Texas when I was two years old. My father was Nelson Brackins and my mother was Rosanna. \"My master settled here at a place called Malone, on the Hondo River. He went into the stock business. Our house there was a little, old picket house with a grass roof over it out of the sage grass. The bed was made with a tick of shucks and the children slept on the floor. The boss had just a little lumber house. Later on he taken us about 20 miles fu\\'ther down on the Hondo, the Old Adams Ranch, and he had a rock house. \"I was about six years old then. I had some shoes, to keep the thorns outa my feet, and I had rawhide leggin\\'s. We just had such clothes as we could get, old patched-up clothes. They just had that jeans cloth, homemade clothes. \"I was with George Reedes 10 or 12 years. It was my first trainin\\' learnin\\' the stock business and horse breakin.\\' He was tol\\'able good to us, to be slaves as we was. His brother had a hired man that whipped me once, with a quirt. I\\'ve heard my father and mother tell how they whipped \\'em. They\\'d tie \\'em down on a log or up to a post and whip \\'em till the blisters rose, then take a paddle and open \\'em up and pour salt in \\'em. Yes\\'m, they whipped the women. The most I remember about that, my father and sister was in the barn shuckin\\' co\\'n and the master come in there and whipped my sister with a cowhide whip. My father caught a lick in the face and he told the master to keep his whip offen him. So the master started on my father and he run away. When he finally come in he was so wild his master had to call him to get orders for work, and finally the boss shot at him, but they didn\\'t whip him any more. Of course, some of \\'em whipped with more mercy. They had a whippin\\' post and when they strapped \\'em down on a log they called it a \\'stroppin\\' log.\\' \"I remember they tasked the cotton pickers in Mississippi. They had to bring in so many pounds in the evenin\\' and if they didn\\'t they got a whippin\\' for it. My sister there, she had to bring in 900 pounds a day. Well, cotton was heavier there. Most any of \\'em could pick 900 pounds. It was heavier and fluffier. We left the cotton country in Mississippi, but nobody knew anything about cotton out here that I knew of. \"I\\'ve heard my parents say too, them men that had plantations and a great lot of slaves, they would speculate with \\'em and would have a chain that run from the front ones to the back ones. Sometimes they would have 15 or 20 miles to make to get them to the sale place, but they couldn\\'t make a break. Where they expected to make a sale, they kept \\'em in corrals and they had a block there to put \\'em up on and bid \\'em off. The average price was about $500, but some that had good practice, like a blacksmith, brought a good price, as high as $1,500. \"I heard my mother and father say they would go 15 or 20 miles to a dance, walkin\\', and get back before daylight, before the \\'padderollers\\' got \\'em. The slaves would go off when they had no permission and them that would ketch \\'em and whip \\'em was the \\'padderollers.\\' Sometimes they would have an awful race. \"If they happened to be a slave on the plantation that could jes\\' read a little print, they would get rid of him right now. He would ruin the niggers, they would get too smart. The\\' was no such thing as school here for culluds in early days. The white folks we was raised up with had pretty good education. That\\'s why I don\\'t talk like most cullud folks. I was about grown and the\\' was an English family settled close, about half a mile, I guess. They had a little boy, his name was Arthur Ederle, and he come over and learned me how to spell \\'cat\\' and \\'dog\\' and \\'hen\\' and such like. I was right around about 20 years old. I couldn\\'t sign my name when I was 18 years old. \"I can remember one time when I was young, I saw something I couldn\\'t \\'magine what it was, like a billygoat reared up on a tree. But I knew the\\' wasn\\'t a billygoat round there near, nor no other kinds of goats. It was in the daytime and I was out in a horse pasture, I was jes\\' walkin\\' along, huntin\\', when I saw that sight. I guess I got within 50 steps of it, then I turned around and got away. I never did think much about a ghost, but I think it could be possible. \"I don\\'t remember scarcely anything about the war because I was so little and times was so different; the country wasn\\'t settled up and everything was wild, no people, hardly. Of course, my life was in the woods, you might say, didn\\'t hardly know when Sunday come. \"The northern soldiers never did get down in here that I know of. I know once, when they was enlisting men to go to battle a whole lot of \\'em didn\\'t want to fight and would run away and dodge out, and they would follow \\'em and try to make \\'em fight. They had a battle up here on the Nueces once and killed some of \\'em. I know my boss was in the bunch that followed \\'em and he got scared for fear this old case would be brought up after the war. The company that followed these men was called Old Duff Company. I think somewhere around 40 was in the bunch that they followed, but I don\\'t know how many was killed. They was a big bluff and a big water hole and they said they was throwed in that big water hole. \"We had possums and \\'coons to eat sometimes. My father, he gen\\'rally cooked the \\'coons, he would dress \\'em and stew \\'em and then bake \\'em. My mother wouldn\\'t eat them. There was plenty of rabbits, too. Sometimes when they had potatoes they cooked \\'em with \\'em. I remember one time they had just a little patch of blackhead sugar cane. After the freedom, my mother had a kind of garden and she planted snap beans and watermelons pretty much every year. \"The master fed us tol\\'bly well. Everything was wild, beef was free, just had to bring one in and kill it. Once in awhile, of a Sunday mornin\\', we\\'d get biscuit flour bread to eat. It was a treat to us. They measured the flour out and it had to pan out just like they measured. He give us a little somethin\\' ever\\' Christmas and somethin\\' good to eat. I heard my people say coffee was high, at times, and I know we didn\\'t get no flour, only Sunday mornin\\'. We lived on co\\'nbread, mostly, and beef and game outta the woods. That was durin\\' the war and after the war, too. \"I was around about 6 or 7 years old when we was freed. We worked for George Reedes awhile, then drifted on down to the Frio river and stayed there about a year, then we come to Medina County and settled here close to where I was raised. We didn\\'t think it hard times at all right after the war. The country was wild and unsettled, with ranches 15 or 20 miles apart. You never did see anybody and we didn\\'t know really what was goin\\' on in the rest of the country. Sometimes something could happen in 5 miles of us and we didn\\'t know it for a month. \"I was on the Adams Ranch on the Hondo when my master come out and told us we were as free as he was. He said we could stay on and work or could go if we wanted to. He gave my mother and father 50 cents apiece and 25 cents for the children. We stayed awhile and then went west to the Frio. \"I used to be along with old man Big-foot Wallace in my early days. He was a mighty fine man. I worked for the people that was gathering stock together there. Big Foot raised nice horses, old reg\\'lar Texas horses, and they was better than the reg\\'lar old Spanish bronco. I used to go to his camp down on the San Miguel. He lived in one part and his chickens in the rest of his house. His friends liked to hear him talk about his travels. He used to run stock horses and had a figger 7 on the left shoulder for his brand and the tip of each ear split was his earmark. \"The last man I broke horses for was Wilson Bailey. I was there about 12 years. He raised just cavi-yard--we called it a cavi-yard of horses, just the same thing as a _remuda_. We called \\'em that later, but we got that from the Spanish. We would get up in a tree with our loop till the horse come under and drop it down on him. When they were so spoilt, we got \\'em in a sort of cavi-yard and drove \\'em under trees and caught \\'em in a snare. We had lots of wild horses, just this side of Pearsall. \\'Bout the only way I\\'d get throwed was to get careless. We\\'d ketch \\'im up, hackamore \\'im up, saddle \\'im up and get on \\'im and let \\'im go. Sometimes he\\'d be too wild to pitch, he\\'d break and run and you had to let \\'im run himself down. I used to rather ketch up a wild horse and break \\'im than to eat breakfast. \"When I first started farmin\\' I taken up some state land, about 80 acres, down on Black Creek, in Medina County. I stayed there ten or twelve years. Cotton hadn\\'t got in this country and I raised some corn, sugar cane and watermelons. I commenced with horses, but \\'long \\'way down the line I used oxen some, too. I used one of those old walking plows. \"I sold that place and moved to a place on the Tywaukney Creek (Tonkawa). I come up to church and met my wife then. Her name was Ida Bradley and I was 38 years old. We lived down on the Tywaukney right about 23 years and raised our children there. We jes\\' had a little home weddin\\'. I wore a suit, dark suit. We got married about 8 o\\'clock in the evenin\\' and we had barbecue, cake and ice cream. You see, in them times I wasn\\'t taught anything about years and dates, but I judge it was about 25 years after the war before I settled on the Tywaukney.\" 420310 GUS BRADSHAW was born about 1845, at Keecheye, Alabama, a slave of David Cavin. He recalls being brought to Texas in the 1850\\'s, when the Cavin family settled near old Port Caddo. Gus remained with his master for ten years after emancipation. He now lives alone on a fifty acre farm seven miles northeast of Marshall, which he bought in 1877. Gus receives an $11.00 per month pension. \"I was born at Keecheye, Alabama, and belonged to old man David Cavin. The only statement I can make \\'bout my age is I knows I was \\'bout twenty years old when us slaves was freed. I never knowed my daddy, but my mammy was Amelia Cavin. I\\'s heard her say she\\'s born in Alabama more times than I got fingers and toes. Our old master brung us to Texas when I\\'s a good sized kid. I \\'members like it am yesterday, how we camped more\\'n a week in New Orleans. I seed \\'em sell niggers off the block there jus\\' like they was cattle. Then we came to old Port Caddo on Caddo Lake and master settles a big farm close to where the boats run. Port Caddo was a big shipping place then, and Dud and John Perry run the first store there. The folks hauled cotton there from miles away. \"Mammy\\'s folks was named Maria and Joe Gloster and they come to Texas with the Cavins. My grandma say to me, \\'Gus, don\\'t run you mouth too much and allus have manners to whites and blacks.\\' Chillen was raise right then, but now they come up any way. I seed young niggers turn the dipper up and drink \\'fore old folks. I wouldn\\'t dare do that when I\\'s comin\\' up. \"Maria say to me one day, \\'Son, I\\'s here when the stars fell.\\' She tell me they fell like a sheet and spread over the ground. Ike Hood, the old blacksmith on our place, he told me, too. I says, \\'Ike, how old was you when the stars fell?\\' He say, \\'I\\'s thirty-two.\\' \"Massa David had big quarters for us niggers, with chimneys and fireplaces. They use to go round and pick up old hawg or cow bones to bile with greens and cabbage. They was plenty of wild game, and deer and wolves howlin\\' right through this country, but you can\\'t even find the track of one now. \"The first work I done was pickin\\' cotton. Every fellow was out at daylight pickin\\' cotton or hoein\\' or plowin\\'. They was one overseer and two nigger drivers. But at night you could hear us laughin\\' and talkin\\' and singin\\' and prayin\\', and hear them fiddles and things playin\\'. It look like darkies git \\'long more better then than now. Some folks says niggers oughtn\\'t to be slaves, but I says they ought, \\'cause they jus\\' won\\'t do right onless they is made to do it. \"Massa David allus give us eggnog and plenty good whiskey at Christmas. We had all day to eat and drink and sing and dance. We didn\\'t git no presents, but we had a good time. \"I don\\'t know much \\'bout the war, only Massa Bob Perry come over one day and say to Grandma Maria, \\'They is surrender, Maria, you is free.\\' She say to him, \\'I don\\'t care, I gwine stay with my white folks.\\' \"The Klu Klux done lots of cuttin\\' up round there. Two of \\'em come to Dr. Taylor\\'s house. He had two niggers what run off from the Klux and they want to whip \\'em, but Dr. Taylor wouldn\\'t \\'low \\'em. I knowed old Col. Alford, one of the Klux leaders, and he was a sight. He told me once, \\'Gus, they done send me to the pen for Kluxing.\\' I say, \\'Massa Alford, didn\\'t they make a gentleman of you?\\' He say, \\'Hell, no!\\' \"I knowed old Col. Haggerdy, too. He marries a widow of a rich old Indian chief, name McIntosh. He broke a treaty with his people and had to hide out in a cave a long time, and his wife brung food to him. One time when she went to the cave he was gone. She knowed then the Indians done git him and kilt him for vi\\'latin\\' the treaty. So she marries old Col. Haggerdy. \"The only time I votes was against whiskey. I voted for it. Some white folks done say they\\'d whip me if I voted for it, but Mr. Joe Strickland done told me they jus\\' tryin\\' scare me, so I voted for it. I don\\'t think niggers ought to vote. If some niggers had things in hand \\'stead of white folks, I couldn\\'t stay here. These eddicated niggers am causin\\' the devilment. The young niggers ain\\'t got no \\'spect for old age. \"I bought and paid for fifty acres land here in Harrison County and I has lived on it sixty years. I lived with my wife fifty years \\'fore she died and done raise two chillen. These young niggers don\\'t stay married fifty days, sometimes. I don\\'t mess with \\'em, but if I needs help I goes to the white folks.

He now lives with friends on the Long\\'s Camp Road, and draws a $11.00 monthly pension. \"I was born and raised in Harrison County, and I was eighty-eight years old this July past and has wore myself out here in this county. I was born on Massa John Jeem\\'s place, on the old Jefferson Road, and my father was Peter Calloway, and he was born in Alabama and his whole fam\\'ly brought to Texas by nigger traders. My mother was Harriet Ellis and I had two brothers named George and Andrew, and four sisters, Lula and Judy and Mary and Sallie. My old Grandpa Phil told me how he helped run the Indians off the land. \"Grandpa Phil told me \\'bout meetin\\' his massa. Massa Jeems had three or four places and grandpa hadn\\'t seed him and he went to one of the other farms and meets a man goin\\' down the road. The man say, \\'Who you belong to?\\' Grandpa Phil say, \\'Massa Jeems.\\' The man say, \\'Is he a mean man?\\' Grandpa say, \\'I don\\'t know him, but they say he\\'s purty tight.\\' It was Massa Jeems talkin\\' and he laughs and gives Grandpa Phil five dollars. \"We niggers lived in log houses and slep\\' on hay mattress with lowell covers, and et fat pork and cornbread and \\'lasses and all kinds garden stuff. If we et flour bread, our women folks had to slip the flour siftin\\'s from missy\\'s kitchen and darsn\\'t let the white folks know it. We wore one riggin\\' lowell clothes a year and I never had shoes on till after surrender come. I run all over the place till I was a big chap in jes\\' a long shirt with a string tied round the bottom for a belt. I went with my young massa that way when he hunted in the woods, and toted squirrels for him. \"Some white folks might want to put me back in slavery if I tells how we was used in slavery time, but you asks me for the truth. The overseer was \\'straddle his big horse at three o\\'clock in the mornin\\', roustin\\' the hands off to the field. He got them all lined up and then come back to the house for breakfas\\'. The rows was a mile long and no matter how much grass was in them, if you leaves one sprig on your row they beats you nearly to death. Lots of times they weighed cotton by candlelight. All the hands took dinner to the field in buckets and the overseer give them fifteen minutes to git dinner. He\\'d start cuffin\\' some of them over the head when it was time to stop eatin\\' and go back to work. He\\'d go to the house and eat his dinner and then he\\'d come back and look in all the buckets and if a piece of anything that was there when he left was et, he\\'d say you was losin\\' time and had to be whipped. He\\'d drive four stakes in the ground and tie a nigger down and beat him till he\\'s raw. Then he\\'d take a brick and grind it up in a powder and mix it with lard and put it all over him and roll him in a sheet. It\\'d be two days or more \\'fore that nigger could work \\'gain. I seed one nigger done that way for stealin\\' a meat bone from the meathouse. That nigger got fifteen hundred lashes. The li\\'l chaps would pick up egg shells and play with them and if the overseer seed them he\\'d say you was stealin\\' eggs and give you a beatin\\'. I seed long lines of slaves chained together driv by a white man on a hoss, down the Jefferson road. \"The first work I done was drappin\\' corn, and then cow-pen boy and sheep herder. All us house chaps had to shell a half bushel corn every night for to feed the sheep. Many times I has walked through the quarters when I was a little chap, cryin\\' for my mother. We mos\\'ly only saw her on Sunday. Us chillen was in bed when the folks went to the field and come back. I \\'members wakin\\' up at night lots of times and seein\\' her make a little mush on the coals in the fireplace, but she allus made sho\\' that overseer was asleep \\'fore she done that. \"One time the stock got in the field and the overseer \\'cuses a old man and jumps on him and breaks his neck. When he seed the old man dead, he run off to the woods, but massa sent some nigger after him and say for him to come back, the old man jus\\' got overhet and died. \"We went to church on the place and you ought to heared that preachin\\'. Obey your massa and missy, don\\'t steal chickens and eggs and meat, but nary a word \\'bout havin\\' a soul to save. \"We had parties Saturday nights and massa come out and showed us new steps. He allus had a extra job for us on Sunday, but he gave us Christmas Day and all the meat we wanted. But if you had money you\\'d better hide it, \\'cause he\\'d git it. \"The fightin\\' was did off from us. My father went to war to wait on Josh Calloway. My father never come back. Massa Jeems cussed and \\'bused us niggers more\\'n ever, but he took sick and died and stepped off to Hell \\'bout six months \\'fore we got free. When we was free, they beat drums in Marshall. I stayed on \\'bout seven months and then my mother and me went to farmin\\' for ourselves. \"I wore myself out right in this county and now I\\'m too old to work. These folks I lives with takes good care of me and the gov\\'ment gives me $11.00 a month what I is proud to git. 420165 JACOB BRANCH, about 86, was a slave of the Van Loos family, in Louisiana, who sold him when a baby to Elisha Stevenson, of Double Bayou, Texas. Jacob helps his son, Enrichs, farm, and is unusually agile for his age. They live in the Double Bayou settlement, near Beaumont, Texas. \"I\\'s bought and fotched here to Double Bayou when I\\'s jes\\' three year old.

Eyesight is so poor someone must lead him to the store or to church. William kneels at his bedside each evening at five and says his prayers. In this ceremony he spends a half hour or more chanting one Negro spiritual after another. \"Yahsur, I was a slave. I was bo\\'n May 13, 1850, on the place of Lawyer Woodson in Lunenburg County, Virginia. It was \\'bout 75 miles southwest of Richmond. They was two big plantations, one on one side the road, yother the yother. My marster owned 75 slaves. He raised tobacco and cotton. I wukked tobacco sometime, sometime cotton. Dere wasn\\'t no whippin\\' or switchin\\'. We had to wuk hard. Marster Woodson was a rich man. He live in a great big house, a lumber house painted white. And it had a great big garden. \"De slaves lives in a long string of log houses. Dey had dirt floors and shingle roofs. Marster Woodson\\'s house was shingle roof too. We had home cured bacon and veg\\'tables, dried co\\'n, string beans and dey give us hoe cakes baked in hot ashes. Dere always was lots of fresh milk. \"How\\'d us slaves git de clothes? We carded de cotton, den de women spin it on a spinnin\\' wheel. After dat day sew de gahment togeddah on a sewin\\' machine. Yahsur, we\\'s got sewin\\' machine, wid a big wheel and a handle. One woman tu\\'n de handle and de yuther woman do de sewin\\'. \"Dat\\'s how we git de clothes for de 75 slaves. Marster\\'s clothes? We makes dem for de whole fam\\'ly. De missis send de pattren and de slaves makes de clothes. Over nigh Richmond a fren\\' of Marster Woodson has 300 slaves. Dey makes all de clothes for dem. \"I was with Marster twel de Yankees come down to Virginia in 1861. De sergeant of de Yankees takes me up on his hoss and I goes to Washington wid de Yankees. I got to stay dere \\'cause I\\'d run away from my marster. \"I stay at de house of Marse Frank Cayler. He\\'s an ole time hack driver. I was his houseboy. I stay dere twel de year 1870, den I goes to Baltimore and jines de United States Army. We\\'s sent to Texas \\'count of de Indians bein\\' so bad. Dey put us on a boat at Baltimore and we landed at Galveston. \"Den we marches from Galveston to Fort Duncan. It was up, up, de whole time. We ties our bedclothes and rolls dem in a bundle wid a strap. We walks wid our guns and bedclothes on our backs, and de wagons wid de rations follows us. Dey is pulled by mules. We goes 15 miles ev\\'ry day. We got no tents, night come, we unrolls de blankets and sleeps under de trees, sometime under de brush. \"For rations we got canned beans, milk and hardtack. De hard tacks is 3 or 4 in a box, we wets \\'em in water and cooks \\'em in a skillet. We gits meat purty often. When we camps for de night de captain say, \\'You\\'all kin go huntin\\'.\\' Before we git to de mountains dere\\'s deer and rabbits and dey ain\\'t no fences. Often in de dark we sees a big animal and we shoots. When we bring \\'im to camp, de captain say, \\'Iffen de cow got iron burns de rancher gwineter shoot hisself a nigger scout.\\' But de cow ain\\'t got no iron, it\\'s--what de name of de cow what ain\\'t feel de iron? Mavrick, yahsur. We eats lots of dem Mavricks. We\\'s goin\\' \\'long de river bottom, and before we comes to Fort Duncan we sees de cactus and muskeet. Dere ain\\'t much cattle, but one colored scout shoots hisself a bear. Den we eats high. Fort Duncan were made of slab lumber and de roof was gravel and grass. \"Den we\\'s ordered to Fort Davis and we\\'s in de mountains now. Climb, climb all day, and de Indians give us a fit ev\\'ry day. We kills some Indians, dey kills a few soldiers. We was at Fort Clark a while. At Fort Davis I jines de colored Indian Scouts, I was in Capt. George L. Andrew\\'s Co. K. \"We\\'s told de northern Cheyennes is on a rampus and we\\'s goin\\' to Fort Sill in Indian Territory.

Iffen you kill \\'em, dey can\\'t git back to de reservation.\\' Den we goes scoutin\\' for de Cheyennes and dey is scoutin\\' for us. Dey gits us first, on de Wichita River was 500 of \\'em, and we got 75 colored Indian Scouts. Den Red Foot, de Chief of de Cheyennes, he come to see Capt. Lawson and say he want rations for his Indians. De captain say he cain\\'t give no rations to Indians off de reservation. Red Foot say he don\\'t care \\'bout no reservation and he say he take what we got. Capt. Lawson \\'low we gotter git reinforcements. We got a guide in de scout troop, he call hisself Jack Kilmartin. De captain say, \\'Jack, I\\'se in trouble, how kin I git a dispatch to Gen. Davidson?\\' Jack say, \\'I kin git it through.\\' And Jack, he crawl on his belly and through de brush and he lead a pony, and when he gits clear he rides de pony bareback twel he git to Fort Sill. Den Gen. Davidson, he soun\\' de gin\\'ral alarm and he send two companies of cavalry to reinforce us.

The town of Branch was known in slave days as Plaquemine Bouley. Clara estimates her age to be 100 or 102, and from various facts known to her and her family, this would seem to be correct. \"Old massa\\'s name was William Lyons. I didn\\'t have no old missus, \\'cause he was a bachelor. He had a big plantation. I don\\'t know how big but dey somethin\\' like twenty fam\\'lies of slaves and some dem fam\\'lies had plenty in dem. My ma was Becky Brim and pa, he name Louis Brim. She come from Old Virginny. Dey work in de field. I had two sister name Cass and Donnie and a brudder name Washington. He went off to de war. When it break out dey come and take him off to work in de army. He lost in dat war. He didn\\'t come back. Nobody ever know what happen to him. \"Some de houses log house and some plank, but dey all good. Dey well built and had brick chimneys. Dey houses what de wind didn\\'t blow in. Us had beds, too, not dem built in de wall. Us sho\\' treat good in slavery times, yes, suh. Old massa give us plenty clothes to keep us good and warm. He sho\\' did. \"Old massa, he wasn\\'t marry and eat de same things de slaves eat. He didn\\'t work dem in de heat of de day. \\'Bout eleven o\\'clock, when dat sun git hot, he call dem out de field. He give dem till it git kind of cool befo\\' he make dem go back in de field. He didn\\'t have no overseer. He seed \\'bout de plantation hisself. He raise cotton and corn and sweet \\'taters and peas and cane, didn\\'t fool with rice. He didn\\'t go in for oats, neither. \"When Sunday come Old Massa ask who want to go to church. Dem what wants could ride hoss-back or walk. Us go to de white folks church. Dey sot in front and us sot in back. Us had prayer meetin\\', too, reg\\'lar every week. One old cullud man a sort of preacher. He de leader in \\'ligion. \"When de slaves go to work he give dem de task. Dat so much work, so many rows cotton to chop or corn to hoe. When dey git through dey can do what dey want. He task dem on Monday. Some dem git through Thursday night. Den dey can hire out to somebody and git pay for it. \"Old Massa even git de preacher for marryin\\' de slaves. And when a slave die, he git de preacher and have Bible readin\\' and prayin\\'. Mostest de massas didn\\'t do dat-a-way. \"I as big in war time as I is now.

He lives in Mart, Texas. \"I\\'s born \\'bout de year 1850, near de Tom Bigbee river in Alabama, on a plantation own by Marse Josiah Collier. My folks was Henderson and Martha Brooks and I\\'s de only child den. \"Marse Collier owned seventy fam\\'lies of slaves and dey all lived in dey quarters \\'bout a mile from de big house. When freedom come Marse Collier sent for all de slaves and lines us up in a row, two deep, and helt up he hands and say, \\'Boys, you is free as I is. All of you what wants to can go, and all of you what wants to can work for me on wages dis year. Next year I\\'ll give you a crop or work for wages.\\' Dey all stays but two, and one of dem two my daddy, and he lef\\' mammy and six chillen and never come back. \"Us stays on till Marse Collier and Missus both dies, and den stays with he oldes\\' gal, and didn\\'t go \\'way till we\\'s growed and has fam\\'lies of our own. \"I \\'members best de Fourth of July. De white folks have lots to eat for dem and us and we plays games and goes swimmin\\'. \"Next thing I \\'members is de patterrollers, \\'cause dey whip me every time dey cotches me without my pass. Dat de way dey make us stay home at night, and it made good niggers out of us, \\'cause we couldn\\'t chase round and git in no meanness. \"Old Marse often told me \\'bout de stars fallin\\'. It was \\'long \\'bout sundown and growed dark all a sudden and de chickens goes to roost. Den some stars with long tails \\'gins to shoot, den it look like all de stars had come out of Heaven, and did dey fall! De stars not all what fell. De white folks and de niggers fell on dere knees, prayin\\' to Gawd to save dem iffen de world comin\\' to a end, and de women folks all run down in de cellar and stayed till mornin\\'. Old Marse say it was in 1833, and he say dem stars fall awhile and quit awhile, like de showers when it rains. \"\\'Bout a year after freedom Old Marse give us a piece of land for a church and dis was de school, too. De preacher\\'s name was Christmas Crawford, and dat de reason I \\'members it, it so funny to us. De nigger teacher named Nimron.

He was born in 1850, but appears vigorous. Light skinned, with blue eyes and a genial expression, he gave the story of his life in the French patois spoken by Louisiana French Negroes, which has been translated into English. \"My mama was daughter of one of the Carmouche boys. One of M\\'sieur Francois\\' sons. She call herself Armance Carmouche. She was house servant for the family and I worked around the house. I remember my Madame brought me the little basket and it had a strap on it. I put the strap over the shoulder and went round with the sharp stick and picked up the leaves on the ground with the stick. \"It was a great house with trees and flowers. Madame liked all clean and pretty. I never worked hard. The ladies and my mama, too, petted me as if I was the white child. \"M\\'sieur had a widow sister. She made us learn the prayers. We were glad to go where she was for she always had something good in her bag for us. I never saw the baptizing. In those days all the slaves had the religion of the master and the Catholics didn\\'t have no baptizing. They didn\\'t have to half-drown when they got their religion. The church was 15 or 20 miles off. The priest came and held Mass for the white folks sometimes. \"I remember one wedding. My aunt got married. M\\'sieur Caramouche killed a big pig. The white folks ate in the house. The slaves sat under the trees and ate in the yard. At four o\\'clock the justice of the peace came. He was the friend of M\\'sieur Caramouche. He made my aunt and the man hold hands and jump over the broom handle. When the priest came he made M\\'sieur sign some papers. \"A slave always had to ask M\\'sieur to marry. He always let the women slaves marry who they wanted. He didn\\'t loose by that. He was so good the men would come to his plantation. \"We all wore the long chemise. Made out of heavy cloth. They made the cloth on the place and the women sewed it up. We didn\\'t wear the shoes. We didn\\'t like them when we had them. \"Each slave could have the little garden. They raised vegetables and had a couple of beehives for the honey. \"When the Yankees came they told us we could be free, but I don\\'t know of any slaves that left. Old M\\'sieur died of the fever in the second year of the war. His wife died before he did. No children. They sold us, the house and everything. M\\'sieur Cyprien Arceneaux of Lafayette bought me and Madame Arvillien Bernard of St. Pierre bought the mama. They used to call it St. Pierre. They call it Carenero now. When war was finished I left M\\'sieur Arceneaux and lived with mama. \"A year and a half after that the mama married a black man and us three farmed the little farm. My steppapa didn\\'t like me. I was light. He and me couldn\\'t get along. So when I had 20 years I left there and hired myself out. I saved till I bought a little piece of land for myself. Then I married and raised the family. Me and my wife and the children farmed that place up to ten years ago and then she died. My son farms the place now and I came to Beaumont. I live with my girl. \"I remember me in time of war we danced. Round dances. We sang and danced La Boulangere in time of war. De song go: \"\\'La Boulangere ait ta victoire Et nous, qui sont en guerre, Voici le jour que je dois partir. \"\\'Mon cher ami, tu pars, Tu me laisses un enfant dans les bras et prend tes armes. Et moi, je vais dans le moment verser des larmes. \"\\'Quand je serai en le guerre, [Handwritten Note: à la guerre?] Tu serais de garnison, Et tu m\\'oublirais moi, Qui serai en les haillons. \"\\'J\\'entends le tombour qui m\\'appelle A les points de jour. Mon cher Armande, si tu m\\'aimes Tu penserais à moi, quand tu serais, Dans tes plaisir. Moi--que serai au bout du fusil!\\' \"I got one real scare. I was with M\\'sieur Arceneaux in Lafayette. There was the battle. Lots of fighting. Lots of killing. The Yankees came right inside the house. I stayed hid. \"I don\\'t know whether it\\'s been better since the war. At all times one has his miseries. We managed to get along on the farm. But now I have nothing. Oh, I don\\'t mean slavery was better than to be free. I mean times were better. \"The reason I\\'m so light is, my mama was half-white. My papa was Neville Broussard and he was all white. 420233 [Illustration: Fannie Brown] FANNIE BROWN, aged Negro of Waco, Texas, does not know her age. She was born near Richmond, Virginia, a slave of the Koonce family. They sold her to Mrs. Margaret Taylor, of Belton, Texas, when Fannie was only five years old, and she never saw her mother again. \"I was borned near Richmond, over in Virginy, but Massa Koonce sold me. When I was five year old he brung me to Belton and sold me to Missy Margaret Taylor, and she kep\\' me till she died. I was growed den and sold to Massa Jim Fletcher and dere I stayed till I was freed. \"Dere no spring near Massa Fletcher\\'s place and us have to git water out de well, what dey call de sweep well.

Fred was eight years old when the Civil War started. During the War, he and a number of other slaves were taken to Kaufman Co., Texas, as refugees, by Henry Bidder, an overseer. He worked five years as a laborer after he was freed, then worked as a cook until 1933. \"Sho\\', I has time to talk to you \\'bout my life, \\'cause I can\\'t work any more and I has nothin\\' but time.

Sometimes when de nigger gits late, \\'stead of comin\\' home and takin\\' de whippin\\' him goes to de caves of de river and stays and jus\\' comes in night time for food. When dey do dat, de dawgs is put after dem and den it am de fight \\'tween de nigger and de dawg. Jus\\' once a nigger kills de dawg with de knife, dat was close to freedom and it come \\'fore dey ketches him. When dey whips for runnin\\' off, de nigger am tied down over a barrel and whipped ha\\'d, till dey draws blood, sometimes. \"Dem fool niggers what sneak off without de pass, have two things for to watch, one is not to be ketched by de overseer and de other am de patter-rollers.

I don\\'t \\'member my daddy a-tall. \"De place was jis\\' a farm, \\'cause dey didn\\'t know nothin\\' \\'bout plantations up dere in Kentucky. Dey raise corn and wheat and garlic and fast hosses. Dey used to have big hoss races and dey had big tracks and I\\'s stood in de middle of dat big track in Lexington and watch dem ex\\'cise de hosses. Sometimes I got to help dem groom some dem grand hosses and dat was de big day for me.

Mr. Bell sold Martha, her mother and four sisters to Joseph Spence, who brought them to Texas. Martha married Andy Bunton in 1880, and they had nine children. Martha now lives with her sister, Susan, on twelve acres of land which their father bought for $25.00 an acre. The farm is picturesquely located on a thickly wooded hill about six miles east of Austin, Texas. \"I was born on New Year\\'s Day. Yes, suh, in 1856, on Massa Bell\\'s plantation over in Tennessee. De name of de town was Murphreesboro, and my mammy and my four sisters and me all \\'longed to Massa John Bell, but he done sold us to Massa Joseph Spence, and dat how I come by my name. \"I \\'members how Massa Spence brung us to Texas in wagons, and the way we knowed when we hit Texas am \\'cause massa \\'gin to talk \\'bout a norther. When dat norther done strike, all de weeds and leaves jus\\' starts rollin\\'. Us poor, ig\\'rant niggers thunk at first dey was rabbits, \\'cause we\\'d never seed a rabbit den. Massa Spence rid his hoss and Missie Spence come \\'long in de richer way, in a coach. De chillen walked mornin\\'s and de older folks walked afternoons. \"Massa Spence come to Montopolis, right nigh to Austin, and settled down. I helped carry dinner pails to de field workers, and dey was full of meat and cabbage and biscuit. Pappy wasn\\'t dere then, \\'cause he was own by Massa Burrows, over in Tennessee. But when his massa died, my massa bought pappy and he come out to Texas. Befo\\' I\\'s a sizeable child, mammy took sick with diphtheria and died and pappy had to be mammy and pappy to us. Pappy was a big-bodied man and on Sunday mornin\\' he\\'d git out of bed and make a big fire and say, \\'Jiminy cripes! You chillen stay in you beds and I\\'ll make de biscuits.\\' He would, too. I laughs when I thinks \\'bout dem big, rye biscuits, what was so big we called dem \\'Nigger heels.\\' Dey sho\\' was big biscuits, but dey was good. We never did git no butter, though, and sometimes we\\'d ask the white chillen to give us a piece of biscuit with butter on it. We got plenty other eats--sliced meat and roastin\\' ears and sweet milk. \"After freedom pappy sent us to school to de white teacher, and dat\\'s why I can read and write. I went to de sixth grade and quit. Pappy was drinkin\\' a lot then. He\\'d take alcohol and mix it with \\'lasses and water. But he was good to us. Sometimes a Texas norther come up and we\\'d be on the way home and we\\'d see something comin\\' what look like a elephant and it was pappy, with a bundle of coats. \"I was twenty-four years old when I married Andy Bunton and he jes\\' rented farms here and yonder. We had a big weddin\\' and pork and turkey and cake. Aunt Lucy Hubbard, what weighed three hundred pounds, done de cookin\\' dat day.

Andy made a purty good livin till he had a paral\\'sis stroke. Poor old feller! In de end, I took care of him and had to work like I was young again. I cut wood and carried water and washed and cooked. I had to feed him. \"I owns my place here. It am twelve acres and pappy bought it long ago for $25.00 de acre.

Ellen is about 78 years old. She now lives in Beaumont, Texas. \"My old massa was name Richmond Butler and he used to have a big plantation over on Whiska Chitto, in Louisiana, and that\\'s where I was born. They used to call the place Bagdad. I was his slave till I six year old and then freedom come. \"I don\\'t \\'member my daddy, but my mammy was name Dicey Ann Butler. I have seven sister and three brudder, and they was Anderson and Charlie and Willie, and the girls was Laura and Rosa and Rachel and Fannie and Adeline and Sottie and Nora. \"Us used to live in a li\\'l log house with one room. The floor was dirt and the house was make jus\\' like they used to make \\'tater house. They was a little window in the back. When I was a baby they wrop me up in cotton and put me in a coffee pot--that how li\\'l I was. But I grows to be more sizable. \"The plantation were a good, big place and they have \\'bout 200 head of niggers. When I gets big enough they start me to totin\\' water to the field. I gits the water out the spring and totes it in gourds. They cut the gourds so that a strip was left round and cross the top and that the handle. They was about a foot \\'cross and a foot deep. Us used to have one good gourd us kep\\' lard in and li\\'l gourds to drink out of. \"Massa never \\'lowed us slaves go to church but they have big holes in the fields they gits down in and prays. They done that way \\'cause the white folks didn\\'t want them to pray. They used to pray for freedom. \"When the white folks go off they writes on the meal and flour with they fingers. That the way they know if us steal meal. Sometime they take a stick and write in front of the door so if anybody go out they step on that writin\\' and the massa know. That the way us larn how to write. \"Old massa didn\\'t give \\'em much to eat. When they comes in out of the field they goes work for other folks for something to eat. \"They jus\\' have a old frame with planks to sleep on and no mattress or nothin\\'. In winter they have to keep the fire goin\\' all night to keep from freezin\\'. They put a old quilt down on the floor for the li\\'l folks. They have a li\\'l trough us used to eat out of with a li\\'l wooden paddle. Us didn\\'t know nothin\\' \\'bout knives and forks. \"I never did git nothin\\' much to eat. My sister she de cook and sometime when the white folks gone us go up to the big house and she give us somethin\\'. But she make us wash the mouth after us finish eatin\\', so they won\\'t be no crumbs in our mouth. \"Massa used to beat \\'em all the time. My brudder tell old massa sometime he git hongry and gwine have to come ask de niggers for somethin\\' to eat. He say he never do that, but he did, \\'cause after freedom he go to West Texas and some niggers with him and he los\\' everything and, sho\\' \\'nough, old massa have to go to my brudder and ask him for food and a shelter to sleep under. Then he say if he had it to do over, he wouldn\\'t treat the hands so bad. \"One time my brudder slip off de plantation and they almost beat him to death. He told \\'em he had to do somethin\\' to git somethin\\' to eat. They used to put \\'em \\'cross a log or barrel to beat \\'em. My mammy had a strop \\'bout eight inch wide they used to beat \\'em with. \"Most clothes what we git is from the Iles, what was rich folks and lives close by. They folks lives in DeRidder, in Louisiana, I hears. They treated the slaves like white folks. \"On Christmas time they give us a meal. I \\'member that. I don\\'t \\'member no other holidays. \"When us git sick us go to the woods and git herbs and roots and make tea and medicine. We used to git Blackhaw root and cherry bark and dogwood and chinquapin bark, what make good tonic. Black snakeroot and swamproot make good medicine, too. \"My mammy told us we was free and we starts right off and walks to Sugartown, \\'bout 8 mile away.

BUTTLER, 87, venerable graduate of Washburn College, Topeka, Kansas, and ex-school teacher, was born a slave to Mr. George Sullivan on his 300 acre plantation in Farquier Co., Virginia. Henry and a number of other slaves were transported to Arkansas in 1863, and Henry escaped and joined the Union Army. He now lives at 1308 E. Bessie St., Fort Worth, Texas. \"My name is Henry H. Buttler and I am past 87 years of age. That figure may not be accurate, but you must realize that there were no authentic records made of slave births. I estimate my age on the work I was doing at the commencement of the Civil War and the fact that I was large enough to be accepted as a soldier in the Union Army, in the year of 1864. \"I was born on the plantation of George Sullivan, in Farquier Co., Virginia. The plantation was situated in the valley at the base of Bull Mountain, and presented a beautiful picture. The plantation consisted of about 30 acres, with about 30 slaves, though this number varied and sometimes reached 50. Mr. Sullivan owned my mother and her children, but my father was owned by Mr. John Rector, whose place was adjacent to ours. \"The slave quarters consisted of a group of one-room log cabins, with no flooring, and very crude furnishings. There were bunks and benches and a table and the fireplace provided the means for cooking and heating. \"The food was wholesome and of sufficient quantity. In that period about all the food was produced and processed on the plantation, which eliminated any reason for failure to provide ample food. The meat was home cured and the ham and bacon had a superior flavor. \"On the Sullivan place there existed consideration for human feelings but on the Rector place neither the master nor the overseer seemed to understand that slaves were human beings. One old slave called Jim, on the Rector place, disobeyed some rule and early one morning they ordered him to strip. They tied him to the whipping post and from morning until noon, at intervals, the lash was applied to his back. I, myself, saw and heard many of the lashes and his cries for mercy. \"One morning a number of slaves were ordered to lay a fence row on the Rector place. The overseer said, \\'This row must be laid to the Branch and left in time to roll those logs out in the back woods.\\' It was sundown when we laid the last rail but the overseer put us to rolling logs without any supper and it was eleven when we completed the task. Old Pete, the ox driver, became so exhausted that he fell asleep without unyoking the oxen. For that, he was given 100 lashes. \"The slaves were allowed to marry but were compelled to first obtain permission from the master. The main factor involved in securing the master\\'s consent was his desire to rear negroes with perfect physiques. On neither plantation was there any thought or compassion when a sale or trade was in question. I have seen the separation of husband and wife, child and mother, and the extreme grief of those involved, and the lash administered to a grieving slave for neglecting their work. All this made the marriages a farce. \"In 1863 Mr. Sullivan transported about 40 of us slaves to Arkansas, locating us on a farm near Pine Bluff, so we would not be taken by the Federal soldiers. The general faithfulness of the slave was noticeable then, as they had a chance to desert and go to free states. But I think I was the only one who deserted Mr. Sullivan. I went to Federal Headquarters at Fort Smith, Arkansas, and was received into the army. We campaigned in Arkansas and nearby territory. The major battle I fought in was that of Pine Bluff, which lasted one day and part of one night. \"After I was mustered out of the army, I set out to get an education and entered a grade school at Pine Bluff. I worked after school at any job I could secure and managed to enter Washburn College, in Topeka, Kansas. After I graduated I followed steam engineering for four years, but later I went to Fort Worth and spent 22 years in educational work among my people. I exerted my best efforts to advance my race. \"I married Lucia Brown in 1880 and we had three children, all of whom are dead. There is just my wife and me left of the family, and we have a $75.00 per month Union soldier\\'s pension. 420283 WILLIAM BYRD, 97, was born a slave of Sam Byrd, near Madisonville, Texas. William was with his master during the Civil War. The old Negro is very feeble, but enjoyed talking about old times. He lives in Madisonville. \"I has a bill of sale what say I\\'s born in 1840, so I knows I\\'s ninety-seven years old, and I\\'s owned by Marse Sam Byrd. My mother\\'s name was Fannie and I dunno pappy\\'s name, \\'cause my mother allus say she found me a stray in the woods. I allus \\'lieves my master was my pappy, but I never did know for sho\\'. \"Our quarters was log and the bed built with poles stuck in the cracks and cowhide stretched over, and we\\'d gather moss \\'bout once a month and make it soft. When it was real cold we\\'d git close together and I don\\'t care how cold it got, we\\'d sleep jes\\' as warm as these here feather beds. \"I split rails and chopped cotton and plowed with a wooden plow and druv Marse Byrd lots, \\'cause he was a trader, slave trade most the time. He was good to us and give us lots to eat. He had a big garden and plenty sugar cane, and brown sugar. We\\'d press the juice out the cane \\'tween two logs and cook it in the big washpot. \"We had sheepskin clothes in cold weather, with the fur part inside, no shoes less\\'n we wropped our feet in fur hides. But them clothes was warmer than these here cotton overalls. They\\'re plumb cold! Marse Sam was full of life and Missus Josie was real good. They had a nice home of that day, made out split logs and four rooms and a hall two ways through it. \"That great iron piece hung jes\\' outside the door and Marse Sam hit it at 3:30 every mornin\\'. If we didn\\'t muster out he come round with that cat-o-nine-tails and let us have it, and we knowed what that bell was for nex\\' mornin\\'. Sometimes when Marse Sam was gone, we\\'d have a overseer. He\\'d let us go swimmin\\' in the creek when the work was done. \"If a nigger was mean Marse Sam give him fifty licks over a log the first time and seventy-five licks the second time and \\'bout that time he most gen\\'rally had a good nigger. If they was real mean and he couldn\\'t do nothin\\' with \\'em, he put them in the jail with a chain on the feets for three days, and fed \\'em through a crack in the wall. \"On Christmas Marse Sam had a great big eggnog and kilt a big beef and had fireworks, and the nigger, he know Christmas was come. We had plenty to eat and eggnog and did \\'bout what we pleased that day and New Year\\'s. The white folks allus said what we\\'d do on them days we\\'d do all year. That\\'s all foolishment, but some still believes in it. \"They give a big dance and all night supper when war started. Then Marse Sam, he carries me for waterboy and cook and to tend his hosses. He had two, and rid one this day and the other nex\\' day. He was \\'fraid one git kilt and then he wouldn\\'t be slam a-foot. \"When them big guns went to poppin\\', I jes\\' couldn\\'t stand it without gittin\\' in a brush top. Then marse goes and gits shot and I has to be his nuss. But, Lawd-a-me, one them Yankee gals, she falls in love with marse whilst he lays nearly dead, and she say, \\'William, he\\'s mine, so you got to take good care of him.\\' And him with a plumb good wife back home! \"When Marse Sam git well, he say he\\'s goin\\' to \\'nother place to fight. He was with General Lee when that old war was over and that there Yankee General Grant takes General Lee prisoner, and Marse Sam won\\'t leave his general, and he say to me, \\'William, you got to go home alone.\\' \"I lights out a-foot to Texas and it\\'s most a year befo\\' I gits home. I travels day and night at first. I buys some things to eat but every time I goes by a farmhouse I steals a chicken. Sometimes I sho\\' gits hongry. When I git to the house, Missus Josie faints, \\'cause she thunk Marse Sam ain\\'t with me and he mus\\' be dead. I tells her he\\'s in prison and she say she\\'ll give me $2.00 a month to stay till he gits back. I\\'s plumb crazy \\'bout a little gal called \\'Cricket,\\' \\'cause she so pert and full of live, so I stays. We gits us a cabin and that\\'s all to our weddin\\'. We stays a year befo\\' Marse Sam comes back. \"He was the plumb awfulest sight you ever done seed! His clothes is tore offen his body and he ain\\'t shaved in three months and he\\'s mos\\' starved to death. Missus Josie she don\\'t even rec\\'nize him and wouldn\\'t \\'low him in till I tells her dat am Marse Sam, all right. He stays sick a whole year. \"I thinks if them Yankees didn\\'t \\'tend to fix some way for us pore niggers, dey oughtn\\'t turn us a-loose. Iffen de white folks in de South hadn\\'t been jes\\' what they is, us niggers been lots worser off than we was. In slavery time when the nigger am sick, his master pay de bills, but when nigger sick now, that\\'s his own lookout. \"I never done nothin\\' but farm and odd jobs. I been married five times, but only my las\\' wife am livin\\' now. My four boys and two gals is all farmin\\' right here in the county and they helps us out. We gits by somehow. 420277 LOUIS CAIN, 88, was born in North Carolina, a slave of Samuel Cain. After Louis was freed, he came to Texas, and has farmed near Madisonville over sixty years. \"I knows I\\'s birthed in 1849, \\'cause I had a bill of sale. It say that. My master traded me to Massa Joe Cutt for a hundred acres of land. That\\'s in 1861, and I \\'members it well. My daddy was Sam Cain, name after old Massa Cain, and mammy was Josie Jones, \\'cause she owned by \\'nother master. Mammy was birthed in North Carolina, but daddy allus say he come from Africy. He say they didn\\'t work hard over there, \\'cause all they et come out the jungle, and they had all the wives they wanted. That was the \\'ligion over there. \"Our quarters was made of logs, in a long shed six rooms long, like cowsheds or chicken houses, and one door to each room. The bed was a hole dug in a corner and poles around and shucks and straw. We\\'d sleep warm all night long, but it wouldn\\'t do in this country in summertime. \"Massa give us plenty to eat. Our cornbread was what you calls water pone bread and cooked in the ashes. We didn\\'t have no stove. Massa was a great hunter and allus had venison and game. They was plenty fish, too. \"Massa Cain was purty good to his slaves and mean to them if they didn\\'t behave. Missy was a good woman. They lived in a two-story rock house with plenty trees all \\'round. \"We worked long as we could see, from four o\\'clock in the mornin\\', and them milked twenty cows and fed the work stock. They was fifty acres and not \\'nough niggers to work it easy. \"If some niggers was mean they\\'d git it. Massa tied they hands to they feet and tied them to a tree and hit \\'bout twenty-five or fifty licks with a rawhide belt. Hide and blood flew then. Next mornin\\' he\\'d turn them loose and they\\'d have to work all day without nothin\\' to eat. He had a cabin called jail for the nigger women, and chain them in with cornbread and one glass of water. \"One nigger run to the woods to be a jungle nigger, but massa cotched him with the dogs and took a hot iron and brands him. Then he put a bell on him, in a wooden frame what slip over the shoulders and under the arms. He made that nigger wear the bell a year and took it off on Christmas for a present to him. It sho\\' did make a good nigger out of him. \"In the summer time they had camp meetin\\' and baptized in the creek, white folks first while the old nigger mammies shouts, and then the niggers. \"On Saturday mornin\\' us men grated corn for bread the next week and the women washed massa\\'s clothes and our\\'n. On Saturday night we\\'d have a dance all night long, and Sunday the men went to see they wives or sweethearts and us young\\'uns went swimmin\\' in the creek. Every night but Saturday we had to go to bed at nine o\\'clock. Massa hit the big steel piece and we knowed it was time to put out the torches and pile in. \"On Christmas I\\'d stand by the gate, to open it for the company, and they\\'d throw nuts and candy to me. That night all the slaves what could brung they banjoes and fiddles and played for the white folks to dance all night. Them great old days are done gone. Most the men be full that good, old eggnog. \"After war come they ain\\'t no more dances and fun, and not much to eat or nothin\\'. Massa git kilt in a big battle and missy took four slaves and brung him home and buried him under a big shade tree in the yard. That the saddes\\' time I ever seen, nobody there to do anythin\\' but missy and neighbor women and some real young niggers like me. She was cryin\\' and all us slaves takin\\' on. It\\'s a wonder we ever did git massa buried. We carried him on our backs to the grave. \"After that we had to carry missy to the mountains and hide her, \\'cause everything, house and sheds and all, was burnt, and all her stock kilt by sojers and outlaws. When she come out of hidin\\' she didn\\'t have a thing, not even a bed. \"But she was a brave woman, and said, \\'Louis, we\\'ll fix some kind of quarters for you.\\' She went to work to rebuild the place. She said, \\'You niggers is free, but I need you and I\\'ll pay you $2.00 a month.\\' She did, too. She cut some logs and builded her one room and then we all build us a room and that was the best we could do. I \\'lieve the Lawd blessed that woman. After freedom, that\\'s how I lived the first year, and she paid me every cent she promised. I stayed with her three years. \"Then I heared of a railroad job in Texas, and married Josie Sewel in a big weddin\\' and we had a great time. I gits a job on that railroad for fifty cents a day and it never lasted more\\'n a year, so I goes to farmin\\'. \"We had fourteen chillun, four dead now, and the rest farmin\\' all over Texas.

Josie, she done die twenty years ago. \"I don\\'t know as I \\'spected massa\\'s land to be \\'vided and give us, but they was plenty of land for everybody, and missy allus treated us right. Wages was terrible small for a long time after I married and sometimes they wouldn\\'t pay us, and we had to beg or steal. I\\'s went a whole two days without nothin\\' to eat. If it hadn\\'t been for them there Klu Klux, sometimes the niggers would have went on the warpath for starvin\\'. But the Klu Kluxers wouldn\\'t let \\'em roam none, if they tried they stretch them out over a log and hit them with rawhide, but never say a word. That was got the niggers--they was so silent, not a sound out of them, and the nigger he can\\'t stand that. \"I gits a pension and works when I can and gits by. Some the young niggers is purty sorry, they\\'s had so much and don\\'t \\'preciate none of it.

After his master died, a son-in-law, Jim Robinson, brought Jeff and 200 other slaves to Austin, Texas. Jeff was 22 when the Civil War began. He stayed with his old master, who had moved to Stewart Mills Texas, after he was freed, and raised 23 children. He says, \"I \\'spect I has near a thous- children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.\" He makes his home among them, drifting over five states when and as he wishes. \"My name am Jeff Calhoun and I was born in Alton, in Alabama, about 1838, \\'cause I\\'s told by my massa. Dat makes me \\'bout 98 year old now. My father was Henry Robinson and my mammy, she Mary Robinson. She was born in Maryland, in Virginia, but didn\\'t know much \\'bout her folks, \\'cause she was sold off young. Dere was four of us brothers and ten sisters, but dey all dead now but me. \"We makes our beds out of forked saplings drove in the ground, \\'cause de floors was dirt. We sets de pole in dat ground and it run to de top of de cabin and we makes one bed down low and one bed above. De big folks sleeps in de low beds and de chillun above, \\'cause dey can climb. \"My massa had 15 chillun and my mamma suckled every one of dem, \\'cause his wife was no good to give milk. \"We allus had lots to eat, but for meat we has to go to de woods and git deer and turkey and buffalo and some bear. I have eat hoss and skunk and crow and hawk. \"We has a big fire to cook on, and to make de corn cakes we put one leaf down and put batter on dat and put another leaf over it and cover with hot ashes and by noon it was done. Same thing for supper. We never have biscuits \\'cept on Sunday or Christmas. \"My mama was de spinner so I has plenty shirts and some britches, and we raises indigo on de place and makes dye of it. We never wore no shoes in de summer and some winters neither. We has a good pair of pants and shirt we wears Sundays and holidays and was married in. \"De way dey done at weddings dem days, you picks out a girl and tell your boss. If she was from another plantation you had to git her bosses \\'mission and den dey tells you to come up dat night and git hitched up. They says to de girl, \\'You\\'s love dis man?\\' Dey says to de man, \\'You loves dis girl?\\' If you say you don\\'t know, it\\'s all off, but if you say yes, dey brings in de broom and holds it \\'bout a foot off de floor and say to you to jump over. Den he says you\\'s married. If either of you stumps you toe on de broom, dat mean you got trouble comin\\' \\'tween you, so you sho\\' jumps high. \"My massa was good to us. He lived in a log house with a floor and was all fixed up with pretty furniture and mirrors and silver on de table. De missus was little and frail, but she was good to us and so was de massa. He wasn\\'t no hand to whip like some of he neighbors. Dey would tied de slaves\\' hands to a pole and whip de blood out of them. Dey was whipped for runnin\\' away. \"I knowed a slave call Ben Bradley and he was sold on de auction block and his massa chained him hand and foot and started for Texas. Dey got to de Red River and was crossin\\' and de chains helt him down and he never came up. And I have a uncle what run off and dey took a pack of hounds--a pack were twelve--and dey got on his trail and I heared dem runnin\\' him. Dey run him three days and nights and took a gun loaded with buck shot but was sposed not to shoot above de legs. Dey come back and said he got away, but some boys was out huntin\\' and finds him and he been shot four times with buck shot. \"De only time we got to rest was Sunday and de fourth of July and Christmas, and one day Thanksgiving. We got de big dinners on holidays. After supper was have corn shuckings, or on rainy days, and sometimes we shucks 500 bushels. We allus picked de cotton in big baskets, and when we gits it all picked we spreads on big and has a celebration. \"I was in Texas when de war broke out and I hauls corn lots of times to de gin where was de soldier camp, and I helped cook awhile and would have been in de battle of Vicksburg only dey takes another man \\'stead of me and he gits kilt.

Sloan and stayed with him until 1883, when Simp married and moved to Marshall. He and his wife live in Gregg Addition, Marshall, Texas, and Simp works as porter for a loan company. \"My name is Simpson Campbell, but everybody, white and black, calls me Simp. I\\'s born right here in Harrison County, on Bill Sloan\\'s place, nine miles northwest of Marshall. I got in on the last five years of slavery. \"Pappy was Lewis Campbell, and he was sold by the Florida Campbells to Marse Sloan and fotched to Texas, but he allus kep\\' the Campbell name. Mammy was Mariah and the Sloans brung her out of South Carolina. She raised a passel of chillen. Besides me there was Flint, Albert and Clinton of the boys, and--let me count--Dinah, Clandy, Mary, Lula, Liza, Hannah, Matilda and Millie of the girls. \"The Sloans lived in a big house, but it wasn\\'t no shanty. They was fixed \\'bout as good as anybody in the county and driv as good hosses and rigs as anybody. They wasn\\'t a mean streak in the whole Sloan family. \"The slave quarters sot in rows right down in the field from the big house. They had beds made to the wall, and all the cookin\\' was on the fireplace. We raised all our meat and corn and garden truck right there on the place and Marse Sloan brung wheat and other rations from Shreveport. The nigger women spinned all the cloth and pappy made shoes by hand, when they kilt a beef. The beef was dried and jetted and hung in the smokehouse. \"Marse\\'s place civered a thousand acres and he had over a hunderd slaves, with a overseer, Johnson, and a nigger driver. Us niggers was treated well but the overseer had order to whip us for fightin\\'. If the nigger driver hit too many licks, the overseer sold him off the place. \"We worked from four till six and done a task after that, and sot round and talked till nine and then had to go to bed. On Saturday night you\\'d hear them fiddles and banjoes playin\\' and the niggers singin\\'. All them music gadgets was homemade. The banjoes was made of round pieces of wood, civered with sheepskin and strung with catgut strings. \"They wasn\\'t no school but Marse Bill larnt some his niggers readin\\' and writin\\' so we could use them bookin\\' cotton in the field and sich like. They was a church on the Sloan place and white preachers done most the \\'xhorting. Mammy allus say the cullud preachers had to preach what they\\'s told--obey you master and missus. \"I seed Yankee sojers and wagons comin\\' home from Mansfield. Marse Tom sot us free right after surrender, but my folks stayed on with him till he died, in 1906. I lef when I\\'s twenty-three and marries and made a livin\\' from public work in Marshall all my life. I worked as day laborer and raised two boys and two girls and the boys is farmin\\' right here in the county and doin\\' well. \"When I\\'s eighteen they got up a \\'mendment to the Constitution and got out a \"People\\'s Party Ticket.\" It was a Democratic ticket and control by Southerners. They told us niggers if we\\'d vote that ticket we\\'d be rec\\'nized as white folks, but I didn\\'t \\'lieve a word of it. Old Man Sloan told all his niggers that and they all voted that ticket but two--that was Charley Tang and Simp Campbell. \"I \\'lieve the young race of our people is progressin\\' fine. If they had priv\\'lege to use they educations, they\\'d make more progress, but the color line holds them back. 420106 [Illustration: James Cape] JAMES CAPE, centenarian, now living in a dilapidated little shack in the rear of the stockyards in Fort Worth, Texas, was born a slave to Mr. Bob Houston, who owned a large ranch in southeast Texas. James\\' parents came direct from Africa into slavery. James spent his youth as a cowboy, fought in the Confederate army, was wounded and has an ugly shoulder scar. After the war, James unknowingly took a job with the outlaw, Jesse James, for whom he worked three years, in Missouri. He then came back to Texas, and worked in the stockyards until 1928. Documentary proof of James\\' age is lacking, but various facts told him by his parents and others lead him to think he must be over 100 years old. \"I\\'s bo\\'n in yonder southeast Texas and I don\\' know what month or de year for sho\\', but \\'twas more dan 100 years ago. My mammy and pappy was bo\\'n in Africa, dats what dey\\'s tol\\' me. Dey was owned by Marster Bob Houston and him had de ranch down dere, whar dey have cattle and hosses. \"When I\\'s old \\'nough to set on de hoss, dey larned me to ride, tendin\\' hosses. \\'Cause I\\'s good hoss rider, dey uses me all de time gwine after hosses. I goes with dem to Mexico. We crosses de river lots of times. I \\'members once when we was a drivin\\' \\'bout 200 hosses north\\'ards. Dey was a bad hail storm comes into de face of de herd and dat herd turns and starts de other way. Dere was five of us riders and we had to keep dem hosses from scatterment. I was de leader and do you know what happens to dis nigger if my hoss stumbles? Right dere\\'s whar I\\'d still be! Marster give me a new saddle for savin\\' de hosses. \"One day Marster Bob comes to me and says, \\'Jim, how you like to jine de army?\\' You see, de war had started. I says to him, \\'What does I have to do?\\' And he says, \\'Tend hosses and ride \\'em.\\' I was young den and thought it would be lots of fun, so I says I\\'d go. So de first thing I knows, I\\'s in de army away off east from here, somewhar dis side of St. Louis and in Tennessee and Arkansas and other places. I goes in de army \\'stead of Dr. Carroll. \"After I gits in de army, it wasn\\' so much fun, \\'cause tendin\\' hosses and ridin\\' wasn\\' all I does. No, sar, I has to do shootin\\' and git shooted at! One time we stops de train, takes Yankee money and lots of other things off dat train. Dat was way up de other side of Tennessee. \"You\\'s heard of de battle of Independence? Dat\\'s whar we fights for three days and nights. I\\'s not tendin\\' hosses dat time. Dey gives me a rifle and sends me up front fightin\\', when we wasn\\' running\\'. We does a heap of runnin\\' and dat suits dis nigger. I could do dat better\\'n advance. When de order comes to \\'treat, I\\'s all ready. \"I gits shot in de shoulder in dat fight and lots of our soldiers gits killed and we loses our supply, jus\\' leaves it and runs. \\'Nother time we fights two days and nights and de Yankees was bad dat time, too, and we had to run through de river. I sho\\' thought I\\'s gwine git drowned den. Dat\\'s de time we tries to git in St. Louis, but de Yankee mans stop us. \"I\\'s free after de war and goes back to Texas, to Gonzales County, and gits a job doin\\' cowboy work for Marster Ross herdin\\' cattle. And right dere\\'s whar I\\'s lucky for not gittin\\' in jail or hanged. It was dis way: I\\'s in town and dat man, Ross, says to me, \\'I unnerstan\\' you\\'s a good cowhand,\\' and he hires me and takes me way out. No house for miles \\'fore we comes to de ranch with cattle and I goes to work. After I\\'s workin\\' a while, I wonders how come dey brings in sich fine steers so often and I says to myself, \\'Marster Ross mus\\' have heaps of money for to buy all dem steers.\\' Dey pays no \\'tention to de raisin\\' of cattle, jus\\' brings \\'em in and drives dem \\'way. \"One time Marster Ross and six mens was gone a week and when dey comes back, one of \\'em was missin\\'. Dey had no steers dat time and dey talks \\'bout gittin\\' frusterated and how one man gits shot. I says to myself, \\'What for was dey chased and shot at?\\' Den I \\'members Marster Bob Houston done tol\\' me \\'bout rustlers and how dey\\'s hanged when dey\\'s caught, and I knows den dat\\'s how come all dem fine steers is driv in and out all de time. But how to git \\'way, dere\\'s de puzzlement. I not know which way to go and dere\\'s no houses anywhere near. I keeps gittin\\' scarter, and ever\\' time somebody comes, I thinks its de law. But Marster Ross drives de cattle north and I says to him, \\'I\\'s good hand at de drive. Kin I go with you nex\\' time you goes north?\\' And not long after dat we starts and we gits to Kansas City. After Marster Ross gets shut of de critters, he says. \\'We\\'ll res\\' for couple days, den starts back.\\' I says to me, \\'Not dis nigger.\\' \"I sneaks \\'way and was settin\\' on a bench when \\'long comes a white man and he\\'s tall, had dark hair and was fine lookin\\'. He says to me, \\'Is you a cowhand?\\' So I tells him I is, and he says he wants a hand on his farm in Missouri and he says, \\'Come with me.\\' He tells me his name was James and takes me to his farm whar I tends cattle and hosses for three years and he pays me well. He gives me more\\'n I earns. After three years I leaves, but not \\'cause I larned he was outlaw, \\'cause I larned dat long time afterwa\\'ds. I\\'s lonesome for Texas and dat\\'s how I comes to Fort Worth and here\\'s whar I\\'s stayed ever\\' since. \"I\\'s married \\'bout 40 years ago to a woman dat had eight chillens.

Mr. Billy Coats bought him and his mother and brought them to Bastrop Co., Texas. He came to Houston 20 years ago and lives in a negro settlement known as Acres Home, about 8 miles northeast of Houston. It is a wooded section, with a clearing here and there for a Negro shack and plots of ground for growing \"victuals and co\\'n.\" \"I wants to tell the Gospel truf. My mammy\\'s name was Melia Carruthers and my papa\\'s name was Max. My papa\\'s papa\\'s name was Carruthers, too. My brothers names was Charlie and Frank and Willie and John and Tom and Adam. \"When I was still little Mr. Billy Coats bought my mama and us and with about 500 of his slaves we set out to come to Texas. We goes to Bastrop County and starts to work. My old missy--her name was Missy Myra--was 99 year old and her head was bald as a egg and had wens on it as big as eggs, too. \"In them days the boss men had good houses but the niggers had log cabins and they burned down oftentimes. The chimney would cotch fire, \\'cause it was made out of sticks and clay and moss. Many the time we have to git up at midnight and push the chimney \\'way from the house to keep the house from burnin\\' up. \"The chairs was mostly chunks of cordwood put on end, or slabs, just rough, and the beds was built like scaffoldin\\'. We made a sort of mattress out of corn shucks or moss. \"My missy, she was good, but the overseer, he rough. His temper born of the debbil, himse\\'f. His name was Tom Hill, but us called him \\'Debbil Hill.\\' Old Debbil Hill, he used to whup me and the other niggers if we don\\'t jump quick enough when he holler and he stake us out like you stake out a hide and whup till we bleed. Many the time I set down and made a eight-plait whup, so he could whup from the heels to the back of the head \\'til he figger he get the proper ret\\'ibution. Sometime he take salt and rub on the nigger so he smart and burn proper and suffer mis\\'ry. They was a caliboose right on the plantation, what look like a ice-house, and it was sho\\' bad to git locked up in it. \"Us got provisions \\'lowanced to us every Saturday night. If you had two in the family, they \\'lowanced you one-half gallon \\'lasses and 12 to 15 pounds bacon and a peck of meal. We have to take the meal and parch it and make coffee out of it. We had our flours. One of them we called biscuit flour and we called it \\'shorts.\\' We had rye and wheat and buck grain. \"If they didn\\'t provision you \\'nough, you jus\\' had to slip \\'round and git a chicken. That easy \\'nough, but grabbin\\' a pig a sho\\' \\'nough problem. You have to cotch him by the snoot so he won\\'t squeal, and clomp him tight while you knife him. That ain\\'t stealin\\', is it? You has to keep right on workin\\' in the field, if you ain\\'t \\'lowanced \\'nough, and no nigger like to work with his belly groanin\\'. \"When the white preacher come he preach and pick up his Bible and claim he gittin the text right out from the good Book and he preach: \\'The Lord say, don\\'t you niggers steal chickens from your missus. Don\\'t you steal YOUR MARSTER\\'S hawgs.\\' That would be all he preach. \"Us niggers used to have a prayin\\' ground down in the hollow and sometime we come out of the field, between 11 and 12 at night, scorchin\\' and burnin\\' up with nothin\\' to eat, and we wants to ask the good Lawd to have mercy. We puts grease in a snuff pan or bottle and make a lamp. We takes a pine torch, too, and goes down in the hollow to pray. Some gits so joyous they starts to holler loud and we has to stop up they mouth. I see niggers git so full of the Lawd and so happy they draps unconscious. \"I kep\\' a eye on the niggers down in the cotton patch. Sometime they lazy \\'round and if I see the overseer comin\\' from the big house I sings a song to warn \\'em, so they not git whupped, and it go like this: \"\\'Hold up, hold up, American Spirit! Hold up, hold up, H-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!\\' \"We used to go huntin\\' and they was lots of game, bears and panthers and coons. We have bear dawgs, fox dawg and rabbit dawg that mostly jus\\' go by the name of houn\\' dawg. Then they have a dawg to run niggers. \"I never tried the conjure, but they would take hair and brass nails and thimbles and needles and mix them up in a conjure bag. But I knows one thing. They was a old gin between Wilbarger and Colorado and it was hanted with spirits of kilt niggers. Us used to hear that old mill hummin\\' when dark come and we slip up easy, but it stop, then when you slip away it start up. \"I \\'member when the stars fell. We runs and prays, \\'cause we thinks it jedgment day. It sure dumb old Debbil Hill, them stars was over his power. \"On Sundays we put shoes on our feet and they was brass toed. They was so hard and stiff they go \\'tump, tump, tump,\\' when we walk. That\\'s the only day we got \\'cept Christmas and we jus\\' got somethin\\' extry to eat. All them women sho\\' knowed how to cook! I often tell my wife how glad I was one mornin\\' when my missy give me a hot, butter biscuit. I goes down and shows it to all the other boys. We didn\\'t git them hot, butter biscuits in them days. \"I used to dance the pigeon wing and swing my partners \\'round. Was them womenfolks knock-kneed? You sho\\' couldn\\'t tell, even when you swung \\'em \\'round, \\'cause they dresses was so long. \"I\\'s been all \\'round the mountain and up on top of it in my day. Durin\\' slave time I been so cold I mos\\' turn white and they sot me \\'fore the fire and poultice me with sliced turnips. Come a norther and it blow with snow and sleet and I didn\\'t have \\'nough clothes to keep me warm. \"When a nigger marry, he slick up his lowers and put on his brass-toed shoes, then the preacher marry him out of the Bible. My pappy have a pass to visit my mammy and if he don\\'t have one, the paddle roller conk him on the head. My grandma and grandpa come here in a steamboat. The man come to Africa and say, \\'Man and woman, does you want a job?\\' So they gits on the boat and then he has the \\'vantage. \"When I was 21 and some more, I don\\'t know jus\\' how old, I was a free man. That the day I shouted. We niggers scattered like partridges. I had a fiddle and I\\'d play for the white folks wherever I went, when they has the balls. I marries after \\'while, but I don\\'t know what year, \\'cause we never done paid no \\'tention to years. My first wife died after a long time, I think \\'bout 34 year and I married another and she died this very year. Jus\\' three months later I marries my housekeeper, named Luvena Dixon, cause I allus lived a upright life and I knowed the Lawd wouldn\\'t like it if I went on livin\\' in the same house with Luvena without we was married. She is 52 year old, and we is happy. 420216 [Illustration: Cato Carter] CATO CARTER was born in 1836 or 1837, near Pineapple, Wilcox County, Alabama, a slave of the Carter family. He and his wife live at 3429 Booth St., Dallas, Texas. \"I\\'m home today \\'cause my li\\'l, old dog is lost and I has to stay \\'round to hunt for him. I been goin\\' every day on the truck to the cotton patches. I don\\'t pick no more, \\'count my hands git too tired and begin to cramp on me. But I go and set in the field and watch the lunches for the other hands. \"I am a hunerd one years old, \\'cause I\\'s twenty-eight, goin\\' on twenty-nine, a man growned, when the breakin\\' up come. I\\'m purty old, but my folks live that way. My old, black mammy, Zenie Carter, lived to be a hunerd twenty-five, and Oll Carter, my white massa--which was the brother of my daddy--lived to be a hunerd four. He ain\\'t been so long died. Al Carter, my own daddy, lived to be very ageable, but I don\\'t know when he died. \"Back in Alabama, Missie Adeline Carter took me when I was past my creepin\\' days to live in the big house with the white folks. I had a room built on the big house, where I stayed, and they was allus good to me, \\'cause I\\'s one of their blood. They never hit me a lick or slapped me once, and told me they\\'d never sell me away from them. They was the bes\\' quality white folks and lived in a big, two-story house with a big hall what run all the way through the house. They wasn\\'t rough as some white folks on their niggers. \"My mammy lived in a hewn-oak log cabin in the quarters. There was a long row of cabins, some bigger than t\\'others, \\'count of fam\\'ly size. My massa had over eighty head of slaves. Them li\\'l, old cabins was cozy, \\'cause we chinked \\'em with mud and they had stick chimneys daubed with mud, mixed with hawg-hair. \"The fixin\\'s was jus\\' plain things. The beds was draw-beds--wooden bedsteads helt together with ropes drawed tight, to hold them. We scalded moss and buried it awhile and stuffed it into tickin\\' to make mattresses. Them beds slep\\' good, better\\'n the ones nowadays. \"There was a good fireplace for cookin\\' and Sundays the Missie give us niggers a pint of flour and a chicken, for to cook a mess of victuals. Then there was plenty game to find. Many a time I\\'ve kilt seventy-five or eighty squirrels out of one big beech. There was lots of deer and bears and quails and every other kind of game, but when they ran the Indians out of the country, the game jus\\' followed the Indians. I\\'ve seed the bigges\\' herds of deer followin\\' the way the Indians drifted. Whenever the Indians lef\\', the game all lef\\' with them, for some reason I dunno. \"Talkin\\' \\'bout victuals, our eatin\\' was good. Can\\'t say the same for all places. Some of the plantations half starved their niggers and \\'lowanced out their eatin\\' till they wasn\\'t fittin\\' for work. They had to slip about to niggers on other places to piece out their meals. They had field calls and other kinds of whoops and hollers, what had a meanin\\' to \\'em. \"Our place was fifteen hunerd acres in one block, and \\'sides the crops of cotton and corn and rice and ribbon cane we raised in the bottoms, we had veg\\'tables and sheep and beef. We dried the beef on scaffolds we built and I used to tend it. But bes\\' of anythin\\' to eat, I liked a big, fat coon, and I allus liked honey. Some the niggers had li\\'l garden patches they tended for themselves. \"Everythin\\' I tell you am the truth, but they\\'s plenty I can\\'t tell you. I heard plenty things from my mammy and grandpappy. He was a fine diver and used to dive in the Alabama river for things what was wrecked out of boats, and the white folks would git him to go down for things they wanted. They\\'d let him down by a rope to find things on the bottom of the riverbed. He used to git a piece of money for doin\\' it. \"My grandmammy was a juksie, \\'cause her mammy was a nigger and her daddy a Choctaw Indian. That\\'s what makes me so mixed up with Indian and African and white blood. Sometimes it mattered to me, sometimes it didn\\'t. It don\\'t no more, \\'cause I\\'m not too far from the end of my days. \"I had one brother and one sister I helped raise. They was mostly nigger. The Carters told me never to worry \\'bout them, though, \\'cause my mammy was of their blood and all of us in our fam\\'ly would never be sold, and sometime they\\'d make free man and women of us. My brother and sister lived with the niggers, though. \"I was trained for a houseboy and to tend the cows. The bears was so bad then, a \\'sponsible pusson who could carry a gun had to look after them. \"My massa used to give me a li\\'l money \\'long, to buy what I wanted. I allus bought fine clothes. In the summer when I was a li\\'l one, I wore lowerin\\'s, like the rest of the niggers. That was things made from cotton sackin\\'. Most the boys wore shirttails till they was big yearlin\\'s. When they bought me red russets from the town, I cried and cried. I didn\\'t want to wear no rawhide shoes. So they took \\'em back. They had a weakness for my cryin\\'. I did have plenty fine clothes, good woolen suits they spinned on the place, and doeskins and fine linens. I druv in the car\\'age with the white folks and was \\'bout the mos\\' dudish nigger in them parts. \"I used to tend the nurslin\\' thread. The reason they called it that was when the mammies was confined with babies havin\\' to suck, they had to spin. I\\'d take them the thread and bring it back to the house when it was spinned. If they didn\\'t spin seven or eight cuts a day, they\\'d git a whuppin\\'. It was consid\\'ble hard on a woman when she had a frettin\\' baby. But every mornin\\' them babies had to be took to the big house, so the white folks could see if they\\'s dressed right. They was money tied up in li\\'l nigger young\\'uns. \"They whupped the women and they whupped the mens. I used to work some in the tan\\'ry and we made the whips. They\\'d tie them down to a stob, and give \\'em the whuppin\\'. Some niggers, it taken four men to whup \\'em, but they got it. The nigger driver was meaner than the white folks. They\\'d better not leave a blade of grass in the rows. I seed \\'em beat a nigger half a day to make him \\'fess up to stealin\\' a sheep or a shoat. Or they\\'d whup \\'em for runnin\\' away, but not so hard if they come back of their own \\'cordance when they got hungry and sick in the swamps. But when they had to run \\'em down with the nigger dogs, they\\'d git in bad trouble. \"The Carters never did have any real \\'corrigible niggers, but I heard of \\'em plenty on other places. When they was real \\'corrigible, the white folks said they was like mad dogs and didn\\'t mind to kill them so much as killin\\' a sheep. They\\'d take \\'em to the graveyard and shoot \\'em down and bury \\'em face downward, with their shoes on. I never seed it done, but they made some the niggers go for a lesson to them that they could git the same. \"But I didn\\'t even have to carry a pass to leave my own place, like the other niggers. I had a cap with a sign on it: \\'Don\\'t bother this nigger, or there will be Hell to pay.\\' I went after the mail, in the town. It come in coaches and they put on fresh hosses at Pineapple. The coachman run the hosses into Pineapple with a big to-do and blowin\\' the bugle to git the fresh hosses ready. I got the mail. I was a trusty all my days and never been \\'rested by the law to this day. \"I never had no complaints for my treatment, but some the niggers hated syrup makin\\' time, \\'cause when they had to work till midnight makin\\' syrup, its four o\\'clock up, jus\\' the same. Sun-up to sundown was for fiel\\' niggers. \"Corn shuckin\\' was fun. Them days no corn was put in the cribs with shucks on it. They shucked it in the fiel\\' and shocked the fodder. They did it by sides and all hands out. A beef was kilt and they\\'d have a reg\\'lar picnic feastin\\'. They was plenty whiskey for the niggers, jus\\' like Christmas. \"Christmas was the big day at the Carter\\'s. Presents for every body, and the bakin\\' and preparin\\' went on for days. The li\\'l ones and the big ones were glad, \\'specially the nigger mens, \\'count of plenty good whiskey. Mr. Oll Carter got the bes\\' whiskey for his niggers. \"We used to have frolics, too. Some niggers had fiddles and played the reels, and niggers love to dance and sing and eat. \"Course niggers had their ser\\'ous side, too. They loved to go to church and had a li\\'l log chapel for worship. But I went to the white folks church. In the chapel some nigger mens preached from the Bible, but couldn\\'t read a line no more than a sheep could. The Carters didn\\'t mind their niggers prayin\\' and singin\\' hymns, but some places wouldn\\'t \\'low them to worship a-tall, and they had to put their heads in pots to sing or pray. \"Mos\\' the niggers I know, who had their mar\\'age put in the book, did it after the breakin\\' up, plenty after they had growned chillen. When they got married on the places, mostly they jus\\' jumped over a broom and that made \\'em married. Sometimes one the white folks read a li\\'l out of the Scriptures to \\'em and they felt more married. \"Take me, I was never one for sickness. But the slaves used to git sick. There was jaundice in them bottoms. First off they\\'d give some castor oil, and if that didn\\'t cure they\\'d give blue mass. Then if he was still sick they\\'d git a doctor. \"They used to cry the niggers off jus\\' like so much cattle, and we didn\\'t think no diff\\'rent of it. I seed them put them on the block and brag on them somethin\\' big. Everybody liked to hear them cry off niggers. The cryer was a clown and made funny talk and kep\\' everybody laughin\\'. \"When massa and the other mens on the place went off to war, he called me and said, \\'Cato, you\\'s allus been a \\'sponsible man, and I leave you to look after the women and the place. If I don\\'t come back, I want you to allus stay by Missie Adeline! I said, \\'Fore Gawd, I will, Massa Oll.\\' He said, \\'Then I can go away peaceable.\\' \"We thought for a long time the sojers had the Fed\\'rals whupped to pieces, but there was plenty bad times to go through. I carried a gun and guarded the place at nighttime. The paddyrollers was bad. I cotched one and took him to the house more\\'n once. They wore black caps and put black rags over their faces and was allus skullduggerying \\'round at night. We didn\\'t use torches any more when we went \\'round at night, \\'cause we was afeared. We put out all the fires \\'round the house at nighttime. \"The young mens in grey uniforms used to pass so gay and singin\\', in the big road. Their clothes was good and we used to feed them the best we had on the place. Missie Adeline would say, \\'Cato, they is our boys and give them the best this place \\'fords.\\' We taken out the hams and the wine and kilt chickens for them. That was at first. \"Then the boys and mens in blue got to comin\\' that way, and they was fine lookin\\' men, too. Missie Adeline would cry and say, \\'Cato, they is just mens and boys and we got to feed them, too.\\' We had a pavilion built in the yard, like they had at picnics, and we fed the Fed\\'rals in that. Missie Adeline set in to cryin\\' and says to the Yankees, \\'Don\\'t take Cato. He is the only nigger man I got by me now. If you take Cato, I just don\\'t know what I\\'ll do.\\' I tells them sojers I got to stay by Missie Adeline so long as I live. The Yankee mens say to her, \\'Don\\'t \\'sturb youself, we ain\\'t gwine to take Cato or harm nothin\\' of yours.\\' The reason they\\'s all right by us, was \\'cause we prepared for them, but with some folks they was rough somethin\\' ter\\'ble. They taken off their hosses and corn. \"I seed the trees bend low and shake all over and heard the roar and poppin\\' of cannon balls. There was springs not too far from our place and the sojers used to camp there and build a fire and cook a mule, \\'cause they\\'d got down to starvation. When some of the guerillas seed the fire they\\'d aim to it, and many a time they spoiled that dinner for them sojers. The Yankees did it and our boys did it, too. There was killin\\' goin\\' on so ter\\'ble, like people was dogs. \"Massa Oll come back and he was all wore out and ragged. He soon called all the niggers to the front yard and says, \\'Mens and womens, you are today as free as I am. You are free to do as you like, \\'cause the damned Yankees done \\'creed you are. They ain\\'t a nigger on my place what was born here or ever lived here who can\\'t stay here and work and eat to the end of his days, as long as this old place will raise peas and goobers. Go if you wants, and stay if you wants.\\' Some of the niggers stayed and some went, and some what had run away to the North come back. They allus called, real humble like, at the back gate to Missie Adeline, and she allus fixed it up with Massa Oll they could have a place. \"Near the close of the war I seed some folks leavin\\' for Texas. They said if the Fed\\'rals won the war they\\'d have to live in Texas to keep slaves. So plenty started driftin\\' their slaves to the west. They\\'d pass with the womens ridin\\' in the wagons and the mens on foot. Some took slaves to Texas after the Fed\\'rals done \\'creed the breakin\\' up. \"Long as I lived I minded what my white folks told me, \\'cept one time. They was a nigger workin\\' in the fiel\\' and he kept jerkin\\' the mules and Massa Oll got mad, and he give me a gun and said, \\'Go out there and kill that man.\\' I said, \\'Massa Oll, please don\\'t tell me that. I ain\\'t never kilt nobody and I don\\'t want to.\\' He said, \\'Cato, you do what I tell you.\\' He meant it. I went out to the nigger and said, \\'You has got to leave this minute, and I is, too, \\'cause I is \\'spose to kill you, only I ain\\'t and Massa Oll will kill me.\\' He drops the hanes and we run and crawled through the fence and ran away. \"I hated to go, \\'cause things was so bad, and flour sold for $25.00 a barrel, and pickled pork for $15.00 a barrel. You couldn\\'t buy nothin\\' lessen with gold. I had plenty of \\'federate money, only it wouldn\\'t buy nothin\\'. \"But today I is a old man and my hands ain\\'t stained with no blood. I is allus been glad I didn\\'t kill that man. \"Mules run to a ter\\'ble price then. A right puny pair of mules sold for $500.00. But the Yankees give me a mule and I farmed a year for a white man and watched a herd of mules, too. I stayed with them mules till four o\\'clock even Sundays. So many scoundrels was goin\\' \\'bout, stealin\\' mules. \"That year I was boun\\' out by \\'greement with the white man, and I made $360.00. The bureau come by that year lookin\\' at nigger\\'s contracts, to see they didn\\'t git skunt out their rightful wages. Missie Adeline and Massa Oll didn\\'t stay mad at me and every Sunday they come by to see me, and brung me li\\'l del\\'cate things to eat. \"The Carters said a hunerd times they regretted they never larned me to read or write, and they said my daddy done put up $500.00 for me to go to the New Allison school for cullud folks. Miss Benson, a Yankee, was the teacher. I was twenty-nine years old and jus\\' startin\\' in the blueback speller. I went to school a while, but one mornin\\' at ten o\\'clock my poor old mammy come by and called me out. She told me she got put out, \\'cause she too old to work in the fiel\\'. I told her not to worry, that I\\'m the family man now, and she didn\\'t never need to git any more three-quarter hand wages no more. \"So I left school and turnt my hand to anything I could find for years. I never had no trouble findin\\' work, \\'cause all the white folks knowed Cato was a good nigger. I lef\\' my mammy with some fine white folks and she raised a whole family of chillen for them. Their name was Bryan and they lived on a li\\'l bayou. Them young\\'uns was crazy \\'bout mammy and they\\'d send me word not to worry about her, \\'cause she\\'d have the bes\\' of care and when she died they\\'d tend to her buryin\\'. \"Finally I come to Texas, \\'cause I thought there was money for the takin\\' out here. I got a job splittin\\' rails for two years and from then on I farmed, mostly. I married a woman and lived with her forty-seven years, rain or shine. We had thirteen chillen and eight of them is livin\\' today. \"Endurin\\' the big war I got worried \\'bout my li\\'l black mammy and I wanted to go back home and see her and the old places. I went, and she was shriveled up to not much of anything. That\\'s the last time I saw her. But for forty-four years I didn\\'t forget to send her things I thought she\\'d want. I saw Massa Oll and he done married after I left and raised a family of chillen. I saw Missie Adeline and she was a old woman. We went out and looked at the tombstones and the rock markers in the graveyard on the old place, and some of them done near melted away. I looked good at lots of things, \\'cause I knowed I wouldn\\'t be that way \\'gain. So many had gone on since I\\'d been there befo\\'. \"After my first wife died I married \\'gain and my wife is a good woman but she\\'s old and done lost her voice, and has to be in Terrell most the time. But I git \\'long all right, \\'cept my hands cramps some. \"You goin\\' take my picture? I lived through plenty and I lived a long time, but this is the first time I ever had my picture took. If I\\'d knowed you wanted to do that, I\\'d have tidied up and put on my best. 420276 JACK CAUTHERN, 85, was born near Austin, Texas. Dick Townes owned Jack and his parents. After they were freed, the family stayed on the plantation, but Jack went to San Angelo, because \"times was too dull in Travis County.\" \"My master was Dick Townes and my folks come with him from Alabama. He owned a big plantation fifteen miles from Austin and worked lots of slaves. We had the best master in the whole county, and everybody called us \"Townes\\' free niggers,\" he was so good to us, and we worked hard for him, raisin\\' cotton and corn and wheat and oats. \"Most the slaves lived in two-room log cabins with dirt floors, over in the quarters, but I lived in master\\'s yard. That\\'s where I was born. There was a tall fence \\'tween the yard and the quarters and the other nigger boys was so jealous of me they wouldn\\'t let me cross that fence into the quarters. They told me I thinked I was white, jes\\' for livin\\' in master\\'s yard. \"Me and young master had the good times. He was nigh my age and we\\'d steal chickens from Old Miss and go down in the orchard and barbecue \\'em. One time she cotched us and sho\\' wore us out! She\\'d send us to pick peas, but few peas we picked! \"Old Miss was good to her cullud folks. When she\\'d hear a baby cryin\\' in the night she\\'d put on boots and take her lantern and go see about it. If we needed a doctor she\\'d send for old Dr. Rector and when I had the measles he give me some pills big as the end of my finger. \"We went to church all the time. Young Miss come over Sunday mornin\\' and fotched all us chillen to the house and read the Bible to us. She was kind of a old maid and that was her pleasure. We had baptisin\\'s, too. One old cullud man was a preacher. Lawd, Lawd, we had shoutin\\' at them camp meetin\\'s! \"I guess we was glad to be free. Old master done die and Old Miss was managin\\' the plantation. She had the whole bunch in the yard and read the freedom paper. The old slaves knowed what it meant, but us young ones didn\\'t. She told everybody they could stay and work on shares and most of \\'em did, but some went back to they old homes in Alabama. \"I stayed a while and married, and came to San Angelo. The reason I come, times was dull in Travis County and I done hear so much talk \\'bout this town I said I was comin\\' and see for myself. That was in 1900 and it was jes\\' a forest here then. I worked eighteen years in McCloskey\\'s saloon, and he gave me ten dollars every Christmas \\'sides my pay and a suit every year. I wish he was livin\\' now. My wife and I was together fifty-two years and then she died. After a long time I married again, and my wife is out pickin\\' cotton now. \"It seem mighty hard to me now by side of old times, but I don\\'t know if it was any better in slavery days. It seems mighty hard though, since I\\'m old and can\\'t work. 420154 SALLY BANKS CHAMBERS, wife of Ben Chambers of Liberty, does not know her age. She was born a slave of Jim Moore, in Oakland, Louisiana. Sally has been married three times and has had seven children, about 54 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. Heavy gold earrings hang from her ears and she dresses, even in midsummer, in a long-sleeved calico shirt, heavy socks and shoes, and a sweeping skirt many yards wide. \"Befo\\' I marry de first time my name am Sally Banks, and I\\'s borned in de old states, over in Louisiana, round Oakland.

Jeptha was sent to school with the white children, and after he was freed, he was sent to school for several years, and became a teacher. He moved to Houston in 1888 and opened a barber shop. Jeptha claims to have been born on Oct. 17, 1835, which would make him 101 years old. He has the appearance of extreme age, but has a retentive memory, and his manner of speaking varies from fairly good English to typical Negro dialect and idiom. \"I\\'ll be 102 years old, come fall, \\'cause my mother told me I was born on Oct. 17, 1835, and besides, I was about 30 years old at the end of the Civil War. We belonged to the Choices and I was born on their plantation. My mother\\'s name was Martha and she had been brought here from Serbia. My father\\'s name was John and he was from the East Indies. They was brought to this country in a slave boat owned by Captain Adair and sold to someone at New Orleans before Master Jezro Choice bought them. I had five sisters and one brother but they are all dead, \\'cepting one brother who lives near Henderson. \"Master Jezro was right kind. He had 50 or 60 slaves and a grist mill and tannery besides the plantation. My white folks sort of picked me out and I went to school with the white children. I went to the fields when I was about 20, but I didn\\'t do much field works, \\'cause they was keepin\\' me good and they didn\\'t want to strain me. \"On Sunday we just put an old Prince Albert coat on some good nigger and made a preacher out of him. We niggers had our band, too, and I was one of the players. \"The master was mighty careful about raisin\\' healthy nigger families and used us strong, healthy young bucks to stand the healthy nigger gals. When I was young they took care not to strain me and I was as handsome as a speckled pup and was in demand for breedin\\'. Later on we niggers was \\'lowed to marry and the master and missus would fix the nigger and gal up and have the doin\\'s in the big house. The white folks would gather round in a circle with the nigger and gal in the center and then master laid a broom on the floor and they held hands and jumped over it. That married \\'em for good. \"When babies was born old nigger grannies handled them cases, but until they was about three years old they wasn\\'t \\'lowed round the quarters, but was wet nursed by women who didn\\'t work in the field and kept in separate quarters and in the evenin\\' their mammies were let to see \\'em. \"We was fed good and had lots of beef and hawg meat and wild game. Possum and sweet yams is mighty good. You parboil the possum about half done and put him in a skewer pan and put him in a hot oven and just \\'fore he is done you puts the yams in the pan and sugar on \\'em. That\\'s a feast. \"Sometimes when they\\'s short of bread the old missus would say, \\'How \\'bout some ash cakes?\\' Then they\\'d mix cornmeal and water and sweep ashes out of the open hearth and bake the ash cakes. \"The master and his boys was all kilt in the war and after freedom I stayed all summer. It was pretty tough on us niggers for a while, \\'cause the womenfolks what was left after the war didn\\'t have money. But Colonel Jones, the master\\'s son-in-law, took me to live in Henderson and paid twenty-five cents a week for more schoolin\\' for me and I learned through fractions. Then I got me a job teachin\\' school about six months a year and in off times I\\'d farm. I did lots of different kinds of work, on the narrow gauge railroad out of Longview and I learned to be a barber, too. But I had to give it up a few years back \\'cause I can\\'t stand up so long any more and now I\\'m tryin\\' to help my people by divine healing. 420243 [Illustration: Amos Clark\\'s Sorghun Mill] [Illustration: Amos Clark] AMOS CLARK, 96, was born a slave of Robert Clark, in Washington County, Texas.

I\\'m lookin\\' for Him to take me away from here.\" 420293 THOMAS COLE was born in Jackson Co., Alabama, on the 8th of August, 1845, a slave of Robert Cole. He ran away in 1861 to join the Union Army. He fought at Chickamauga, under Gen. Rosecran and at Chattanooga, Look Out Mt. and Orchard Knob, under Gen. Thomas. After the war he worked as switchman in Chattanooga until his health failed due to old age. He then came to Texas and lives with his daughter, in Corsicana. Thomas is blind. \"I might as well begin far back as I remember and tell you all about myself. I was born over in Jackson County, in Alabama, on August 8, 1845. My mother was Elizabeth Cole, her bein\\' a slave of Robert Cole, and my father was Alex Gerrand, \\'cause he was John Gerrand\\'s slave. I was sposed to take my father\\'s name, but he was sech a bad, ornery, no-count sech a human, I jes\\' taken my old massa\\'s name. My mother was brung from Virginny by Massa Dr. Cole, and she nussed all his six chillen. My sister\\'s name was Sarah and my brother\\'s name was Ben and we lived in one room of the big house, and allus had a good bed to sleep in and good things to eat at the same table, after de white folks gits through. \"I played with Massa Cole\\'s chillen all de time, and when I got older he started me workin\\' by totin\\' wood and sech odd jobs, and feedin\\' de hawgs. Us chillen had to pick cotton every fall. De big baskets weigh about seventy-five to a hundred pounds, but us chillen put our pickin\\'s in some growed slave\\'s basket. De growed slaves was jes\\' like a mule. He work for grub and clothes, and some of dem didn\\'t have as easier a time as a mule, for mules was fed good and slaves was sometimes half starved. But Massa Cole was a smart man and a good man with it. He had \\'spect for the slaves\\' feelin\\'s and didn\\'t treat dem like dumb brutes, and \\'lowed dem more privileges dan any other slaveholder round dere. He was one of de best men I ever knows in my whole life and his wife was jes\\' like him. Dey had a big, four-room log house with a big hall down the center up and down. De logs was all peeled and de chinkin\\' a diff\\'rent color from de logs and covered with beads. De kitchen am a one-room house behin\\' de big house with de big chimney to cook on. Dat where all de meals cooked and carry to de house. \"In winter massa allus kill from three to four hundred hawgs, de two killin\\'s he done in November and January. Some kill and stick, some scald and scrape, and some dress dem and cut dem up and render de lard. Dey haul plenty hick\\'ry wood to de smokehouse and de men works in shifts to keep de smoke fire goin\\' sev\\'ral days, den hangs de meat in de meathouse. First us eat all de chitlin\\'s, den massa begin issuin\\' cut-back bones to each fam\\'ly, and den \\'long come de spareribs, den de middlin\\' or a shoulder, and by dat time he kill de second time and dis was to go all over \\'gain. Each fam\\'ly git de same kind of meat each week. Iffen one git a ham, dey all git a ham. All de ears and feet was pickle and we eats dem, too. If de meat run out \\'fore killin\\' time, us git wild turkeys or kill a beef or a goat, or git a deer. \"Massa let us plant pumpkins and have a acre or two for watermelons, iffen us work dem on Saturday evenin\\'s. Dere a orchard of \\'bout five or six acres peaches and apples and he \\'low us to have biscuits once a week. Yes, we had good eatin\\' and plenty of it den. \"Massa had one big, stout, healthy lookin\\' slave \\'bout six foot, four inches tall, what he pay $3,000 for. He bought six slaves I knows of and give from $400 up for dem. He never sold a slave \\'less he git onruly. \"Massa allus give us cotton clothes for summer and wool for winter, \\'cause he raised cotton and sheep. Den each fam\\'ly have some chickens and sell dem and de eggs and maybe go huntin\\' and sell de hides and git some money. Den us buy what am Sunday clothes with dat money, sech as hats and pants and shoes and dresses. \"We\\'d git up early every day in de year, rain or shine, hot or cold. A slave blowed de horn and dere no danger of you not wakin\\' up when dat blowed long and loud. He climb up on a platform \\'bout ten feet tall to blow dat bugle. We\\'d work till noon and eat in de shade and rest \\'bout a hour or a little more iffen it hot, but only a hour if it cold. You is allus tired when you makes de day like dat on de plantation and you can\\'t play all night like de young folks does now. But us lucky, \\'cause Massa Cole don\\'t whip us. De man what have a place next ours, he sho\\' whip he slaves. He have de cat-o-nine tails of rawhide leather platted round a piece of wood for a handle. De wood \\'bout ten inches long and de leather braided on past de stock quite a piece, and \\'bout a foot from dat all de strips tied in a knot and sprangle out, and makes de tassle. Dis am call de cracker and it am what split de hide. Some folks call dem bullwhips, \\'stead of cat-o-nine tails. De first thing dat man do when he buy a slave, am give him de whippin\\'. He call it puttin\\' de fear of Gawd in him. \"Massa Cola \\'low us read de Bible. He awful good \\'bout dat. Most de slaveowners wouldn\\'t \\'low no sech. Uncle Dan he read to us and on Sunday we could go to church. De preacher baptize de slaves in de river. Dat de good, old-time \\'ligion, and us all go to shoutin\\' and has a good time. Dis gen\\'ration too dig\\'fied to have de old-time \\'ligion. \"When baptizin\\' comes off, it almost like goin\\' to de circus. People come from all over and dey all singin\\' songs and everybody take dere lunch and have de good time. Massa Cole went one time and den he git sick, and next summer he die. Missy Cole, she moves to Huntsville, in Alabama. But she leave me on de plantation, \\'cause I\\'m big and stout den. She takes my mother to cook and dat de last time I ever seed my mother. Missy Cole buys de fine house in Huntsville my mother tells me to be good and do all de overseer tells me. I told her goodbye and she never did git to come back to see me, and I never seed her and my brother and sister \\'gain. I don\\'t know whether dey am sold or not. \"I thinks to myself, dat Mr. Anderson, de overseer, he\\'ll give me dat cat-o-nine tails de first chance he gits, but makes up my mind he won\\'t git de chance, \\'cause I\\'s gwine run off de first chance I gits. I didn\\'t know how to git out of dere, but I\\'s gwine north where dere ain\\'t no slaveowners. In a year or so dere am \\'nother overseer, Mr. Sandson, and he give me de log house and de gal to do my cookin\\' and sich. Dere am war talk and we \\'gins gwine to de field earlier and stayin\\' later. Corn am haul off, cotton am haul off, hawgs and cattle am rounded up and haul off and things \\'gins lookin\\' bad. De war am on, but us don\\'t see none of it. But \\'stead of eatin\\' cornbread, us eats bread out of kaffir corn and maize. \"We raises lots of okra and dey say it gwine be parch and grind to make coffee for white folks. Dat didn\\'t look good either. Dat winter, \\'stead of killin\\' three or four hundred hawgs like we allus done befo\\', we only done one killin\\' of a hundred seventy-five, and dey not all big ones, neither. When de meat supply runs low, Mr. Sandson sends some slaves to kill a deer or wild hawgs or jes\\' any kind of game. He never sends me in any dem bunches but I hoped he would and one day he calls me to go and says not to go off de plantation too far, but be sho\\' bring home some meat. Dis de chance I been wantin\\', so when we gits to de huntin\\' ground de leader says to scatter out, and I tells him me and \\'nother man goes north and make de circle round de river and meet \\'bout sundown. I crosses de river and goes north. I\\'s gwine to de free country, where dey ain\\'t no slaves. I travels all dat day and night up de river and follows de north star. Sev\\'ral times I thunk de blood houn\\'s am trailin\\' me and I gits in de big hurry. I\\'s so tired I couldn\\'t hardly move, but I gits in a trot. \"I\\'s hopin\\' and prayin\\' all de time I meets up with dat Harriet Tubman woman. She de cullud women what takes slaves to Canada. She allus travels de underground railroad, dey calls it, travels at night and hides out in de day. She sho\\' sneaks dem out de South and I thinks she\\'s de brave woman. \"I eats all de nuts and kills a few swamp rabbits and cotches a few fish. I builds de fire and goes off \\'bout half a mile and hides in de thicket till it burns down to de coals, den bakes me some fish and rabbit. I\\'s shakin\\' all de time, \\'fraid I\\'d git cotched, but I\\'s nearly starve to death. I puts de rest de fish in my cap and travels on dat night by de north star and hides in a big thicket de nex\\' day and along evenin\\' I hears guns shootin\\'. I sho\\' am scart dis time, sho\\' \\'nough. I\\'s scart to come in and scart to go out, and while I\\'s standin\\' dere, I hears two men say, \\'Stick you hands up, boy. What you doin?\\' I says, \\'Uh-uh-uh, I dunno. You ain\\'t gwine take me back to de plantation, is you?\\' Dey says, \\'No. Does you want to fight for de North?\\' I says I will, \\'cause dey talks like northern men. Us walk night and day and gits in Gen. Rosecran\\'s camp and dey thunk I\\'s de spy from de South. Dey asks me all sorts of questions and says dey\\'ll whip me if I didn\\'t tell dem what I\\'s spyin\\' \\'bout. Fin\\'ly dey \\'lieves me and puts me to work helpin\\' with de cannons. I feels \\'portant den, but I didn\\'t know what was in front of me, or I \\'spects I\\'d run off \\'gain. \"I helps sot dem cannons on dis Chickamauga Mountain, in hidin\\' places. I has to go with a man and wait on him and dat cannon. First thing I knows, bang, bang, boom, things has started, and guns am shootin\\' faster dan you can think, and I looks round for de way to run. But dem guns am shootin\\' down de hill in front of me and shootin\\' at me, and over me and on both sides of me. I tries to dig me a hole and git in it. All dis happen right now, and first thing I knows, de man am kickin\\' me and wantin\\' me to holp him keep dat cannon loaded. Man, I didn\\'t want no cannon, but I has to help anyway. We fit till dark and de Rebels got more men dan us, so Gen. Rosecran sends de message to Gen. Woods to come help us out. When de messenger slips off, I sho\\' wish it am me slippin\\' off, but I didn\\'t want to see no Gen. Woods. I jes\\' wants to git back to dat old plantation and pick more cotton. I\\'d been willin\\' to do mos\\' anything to git out that mess, but I done told Gen. Rosecran I wants to fight de Rebels and he sho\\' was lettin\\' me do it. He wasn\\'t jes\\' lettin\\' me do it, he was makin\\' me do it. I done got in dere and he wouldn\\'t let me out. \"White folks, dere was men layin\\' wantin\\' help, wantin\\' water, with blood runnin\\' out dem and de top or sides dere heads gone, great big holes in dem. I jes\\' promises de good Lawd if he jes\\' let me git out dat mess, I wouldn\\'t run off no more, but I didn\\'t know den he wasn\\'t gwine let me out with jes\\' dat battle. He gwine give me plenty more, but dat battle ain\\'t over yet, for nex\\' mornin\\' de Rebels \\'gins shootin\\' and killin\\' lots of our men, and Gen. Woods ain\\'t come, so Gen. Rosecran orders us to \\'treat, and didn\\'t have to tell me what he said, neither. De Rebels comes after us, shootin\\', and we runs off and leaves dat cannon what I was with settin\\' on de hill, and I didn\\'t want dat thing nohow. \"We kep\\' hotfootin\\' till we gits to Chattanooga and dere is where we stops. Here comes one dem Rebel generals with de big bunch of men and gits right on top of Look Out Mountain, right clost to Chattanooga, and wouldn\\'t let us out. I don\\'t know jes\\' how long, but a long time. Lots our hosses and mules starves to death and we eats some de hosses. We all like to starve to death ourselves. Chattanooga is in de bend de Tennessee River and on Look Out Mountain, on de east, am dem Rebels and could keep up with everything we done. After a long time a Gen. Thomas gits in some way. He finds de rough trail or wagon road round de mountain \\'long de river and supplies and men comes by boat up de river to dis place and comes on into Chattanooga. More Union men kep\\' comin\\' and I guess maybe six or eight generals and dey gits ready to fight. It am long late in Fall or early winter. \"Dey starts climbin\\' dis steep mountain and when us gits three-fourths de way up it am foggy and you couldn\\'t see no place. Everything wet and de rocks am slick and dey \\'gins fightin\\'. I \\'spect some shoots dere own men, \\'cause you couldn\\'t see nothin\\', jes\\' men runnin\\' and de guns roarin\\'. Fin\\'ly dem Rebels fled and we gits on Look Out Mountain and takes it. \"Dere a long range of hills leadin\\' \\'way from Look Out Mountain, nearly to Missionary Ridge. Dis ridge \\'longside de Chickamauga River, what am de Indian name, meanin\\' River of Death. Dey fights de Rebels on Orchard Knob hill and I wasn\\'t in dat, but I\\'s in de Missionary Ridge battle. We has to come out de timber and run \\'cross a strip or openin\\' up de hill. Dey sho\\' kilt lots our men when we runs \\'cross dat openin\\'. We runs for all we\\'s worth and uses guns or anything we could. De Rebels turns and runs off and our soldiers turns de cannons round what we\\'s capture, and kilt some de Rebels with dere own guns. \"I never did git to where I wasn\\'t scart when we goes into de battle. Dis de last one I\\'s in and I\\'s sho\\' glad, for I never seed de like of dead and wounded men. We picks dem up, de Rebels like de Unions, and doctors dem de bes\\' we could. When I seed all dat sufferin\\', I hopes I never lives to see \\'nother war. Dey say de World War am worse but I\\'s too old to go. \"I sho\\' wishes lots of times I never run off from de plantation. I begs de General not to send me on any more battles, and he says I\\'s de coward and sympathizes with de South. But I tells him I jes\\' couldn\\'t stand to see all dem men layin\\' dere dyin\\' and hollerin\\' and beggin\\' for help and a drink of water, and blood everywhere you looks. Killin\\' hawgs back on de plantation didn\\'t bother me none, but dis am diff\\'rent. \"Fin\\'ly de General tells me I can go back to Chattanooga and guard de supplies in camp dere and take care de wounded soldiers and prisoners. A bunch of men is with me and we has all we can do. We gits de orders to send supplies to some general and it my job to help load de wagons or box cars or boats. A train of wagons leaves sometimes. We gits all dem supplies by boat, and Chattanooga am de \\'stributing center. When winter comes, everybody rests awhile and waits for Spring to open. De Union general sends in some more cullud soldiers. Dere ain\\'t been many cullud men but de las\\' year de war dere am lots. De North and de South am takin\\' anything dey can git to win de war. \"When Spring breaks and all de snow am gone, and de trees \\'gins puttin\\' out and everything \\'gins to look purty and peaceable-like, makin\\' you think you ought to be plowin\\' and plantin\\' a crop, dat when de fightin\\' starts all over \\'gain, killin\\' men and burnin\\' homes and stealin\\' stock and food. Den dey sends me out to help clear roads and build temp\\'rary bridges. We walks miles on muddy ground, \\'cross rivers, wadin\\' water up to our chins. We builds rafts and pole bridges to git de mules and hosses and cannons \\'cross, and up and down hills, and cuts roads through timber. \"But when dey wants to battle Gen. Thomas allus leaves me in camp to tend de supplies. He calls me a coward, and I sho\\' glad he thunk I was. I wasn\\'t no coward, I jes\\' couldn\\'t stand to see all dem people tore to pieces. I hears \\'bout de battle in a thick forest and de trees big as my body jes\\' shot down. I seed dat in de Missionary Ridge battle, too. \"I shifts from one camp to \\'nother and fin\\'ly gits back to Chattanooga. I bet durin\\' my time I handles \\'nough ammunition to kill everybody in de whole United States. I seed mos\\' de mainest generals in de Union Army and some in de Rebel Army. \"After de war am over we\\'s turned loose, nowhere to go and nobody to help us. I couldn\\'t go South, for dey calls me de traitor and sho\\' kill me iffen dey knows I fit for de North. I does any little job I can git for \\'bout a year and fin\\'ly gits work on de railroad, in Stevenson, in Alabama. I gits transfer to Chattanooga and works layin\\' new tracks and turn tables and sich. \"In \\'bout two weeks I had saw a gal next door, but I\\'s bashful. But after payday I dresses up and takes her to a dance. We sparks \\'bout two months and den we\\'s married at her uncles. Her name am Nancy. We buys a piece of land and I has a two-room house built on it. We has two chillen and I\\'s livin\\' with de baby gal now. \"I \\'lieve de slaves I knowed as a whole was happier and better off after \\'mancipation dan befo\\'. Of course, de first few years it was awful hard to git \\'justed to de new life. All de slaves knowed how to do hard work, and dat de old slaves life, but dey didn\\'t know nothin\\' \\'bout how to \\'pend on demselves for de livin\\'. My first year was hard, but dere was plenty wild game in dem days. De south was broke and I didn\\'t hear of no slaves gittin\\' anything but to crop on de halves. Dey too glad to be free and didn\\'t want nothin\\'. \"Things \\'gin to git bad for me in Chattanooga as de white men finds out I run off from de South and jined de North. Some de brakemen try to git my job. I fin\\'ly quits when one of dem opens a switch I jus\\' closed. I seed him and goes back and fixes de switch, but I quits de job. I goes up north but dey ain\\'t int\\'rested, so I comes back and sells my home and buys me a team and wagon. I loads it with my wife and chillen and a few things and starts for Texas. We\\'s on de road \\'bout six weeks or two months. We fishes and hunts every day and de trip didn\\'t cost much. I buys ninety acres in timber in Cass County and cuts logs for a house and builds a two-room house and log crib. My wife built a stomp lot for de team and cow and a rail fence. \"We got \\'nough land cleared for de small crop, \\'bout thirty acres, and builds de barn and sheds outselves. We lived there till de chillen am growed. My wife died of chills and fever and den my boy and I built a four-room house of planks from our timber. Den I gits lonesome, \\'cause de chillen gone, and sells de place. I bought it for fifty cents de acre and sold it for $12.00 de acre. \"I buys sixty acres in Henderson County for $15.00 a acre and marries de second time. I didn\\'t care for her like Nancy. All she think \\'bout am raisin\\' de devil and never wants to work or save anything. She like to have broke me down befo\\' I gits rid of her. I stayed and farmed sev\\'ral years. \"My son-in-law rents land in Chambers Creek bottom, and he usually gits he crop \\'fore de flood gits it. We has some hawgs to kill ev\\'ry winter and we has our cornmeal and milk and eggs and chickens, so de \\'pression ain\\'t starved us yit. We all got might\\' nigh naked durin\\' de \\'pression. I feeds de hawgs and chickens night and mornin\\'. I can\\'t see dem, but I likes to listen to dem eatin\\' and cackle. People don\\'t know how dey\\'s blessed with good eyes, till dey loses dem. Everybody ought to be more thankful dan they is. \"I ain\\'t never voted in my life. I leans to de \\'publicans. I don\\'t know much \\'bout politics, though. \"Today I is broke, \\'cause I spent all my money for med\\'cine and doctors, but I gits a small pension and I spends it mos\\' careful. 420270 ELI COLEMAN, 91, was born a slave of George Brady, in Kentucky. Eli\\'s memory is poor and his story is somewhat sketchy. He now lives in Madisonville, Texas. \"I has a old bill of sale, and it shows I\\'s born in 1846 and my massa am George Brady. I know my pappy\\'s name was same as mine, and mammy was Ella, and I had one brother named Sam, and my sisters was Sadie and Rosa and Viola. They\\'s all dead now. \"Pappy was owned by Massa Coleman, what was brother to Massa Brady. Pappy could only see mammy once a week when he\\'s courtin\\' for her. I heard pappy tell \\'bout his pappy, over in Africy, and he had near a hundred wives and over three hundred chillen. \"Pappy never did work. All he ever did was trade. He\\'d make one thing and \\'nother and trade it for something to eat. He could get lots of fruit and game out of the woods them days, and there was lots of fish. \"Our log house was built of logs, trimmed, and had six rooms. It was long, like a cowbarn or chicken house, and my room was third. We had one door to each room, covered over with hides. We dug out one corner for the bed and fenced it up and gathered straw and moss and tore-up corn shucks, and put in the corner to sleep on. What I mean, it was a warm bed. \"We did all kinds of work, choppin\\' cotton and split rails and cut rock, and work in the tobacco field. We\\'d cut that tobacco and hang it in the shed to dry. It had to be hanged by the stubble end. \"We had plenty to eat, sech as corn pones. The corn was grated by hand and cooked in ashes, and no salt or soda or fancy things like they put in bread now. \"There was possum and rabbit and we cooked them different to now. A great big, old pot hung over the old rock fireplace. Food cooked that way still eats good. Massa Brady allus give us lots out of the garden. He fed us reg\\'lar on good, \\'stantial food, jus\\' like you\\'d tend to you hoss, if you had a real good one. \"Massa Brady, he was one these jolly fellows and a real good man, allus good to his black folks. Missy, she was plumb angel. They lived in a old stone house with four big rooms. It was the best house in the whole county and lots of shade trees by it. \"We had \\'bout a hundred acres in our plantation and started to the field \\'fore daylight and worked long as we could see, and fed ane stock and got to bed \\'bout nine o\\'clock. Massa whopped a slave if he got stubborn or lazy. He whopped one so hard that slave said he\\'d kill him. So Massa done put a chain round his legs, so he jus\\' hardly walk, and he has to work in the field that way. At night he put \\'nother chain round his neck and fastened it to a tree. After three weeks massa turnt him loose and that the proudes\\' nigger in the world, and the hardes\\' workin\\' nigger massa had after that. \"On Saturday night we could git a pass or have a party on our own place. Through the week we\\'d fall into our quarters and them patterrollers come walk all over us, and we\\'d be plumb still, but after they done gone some niggers gits up and out. \"On Christmas Day massa make a great big eggnog and let us have all we wants with a big dinner. He kilt a yearlin\\' and made plenty barbecue for us. \"Massa was a colonel in the war and took me along to care for his hoss and gun. Them guns, you couldn\\'t hear nothin\\' for them poppin\\'. Us niggers had to go all over and pick up them what got kilt. Them what was hurt we carried back. Them what was too bad hurt we had to carry to the burying place and the white man\\'d finish killin\\' them, so we could roll them in the hole. \"When massa say we\\'re free, we all \\'gun to take on. We didn\\'t have no place to go and asked massa could we stay, but he say no. But he did let some stay and furnished teams and something to eat and work on the halves. I stayed and was sharecropper, and that was when slavery start, for when we got our cop made it done take every bit of it to pay our debts and we had nothing left to buy winter clothes or pay doctor bills. \"\\'Bout a year after the war I marries Nora Brady, jus\\' a home weddin\\'. I asks her to come live with me as my wife and she \\'greed and she jus\\' moved her clothes to my room and we lived together a long time. One mornin\\' Nora jus\\' died, and there warn\\'t no chillen, so I sets out for Texas. I done hear the railroad is buildin\\' in Texas and they hires lots of niggers. I gits a hoss from massa and rolls up a few clothes and gits my gun. \"I never got very far \\'fore the Indians takes my hoss away from me. It was \\'bout fifty mile to a train and I didn\\'t have no money, but I found a white man what wants wood cut and I works near a month for him and gits $2.00. I gits on a train and comes a hundred mile from where that railroad was goin\\' \\'cross the country, and I has to walk near all that hundred miles. Once and now a white man comin\\' or goin\\' lets me ride. But I got there and the job pays me sixty cents a day. That was lots of money them days. Near as I \\'member, it was 1867 or 1868 when I comes to Texas. \"Then I marries Agnes Frazer, and we has a big weddin\\' and a preacher and a big supper for two or three weeks. Her pappy kilt game and we et barbecue all the time. We had eleven chillen, one a year for a long time, five boys and six gals. One made a school teacher and I ain\\'t seen her nearly forty-five years, \\'cause she done took a notion to go north and they won\\'t let her back in Texas \\'cause she married a white man in New York. I don\\'t like that. She don\\'t have no sense or she wouldn\\'t done that, no, sir. \"Since the nigger been free it been Hell on the poor old nigger. He has advance some ways, but he\\'s still a servant and will be, long as Gawd\\'s curse still stay on the Negro race. We was turnt loose without nothin\\' and done been under the white man rule so long we couldn\\'t hold no job but labor. I worked most two years on that railroad and the rest my life I farms. Now I gits a little pension from the gov\\'ment and them white folks am sho\\' good to give it to me, \\'cause I ain\\'t good for work no more. 420003 [Illustration: Preely Coleman] PREELY COLEMAN was born in 1852 on the Souba farm, near New Berry, South Carolina, but he and his mother were sold and brought to Texas when Preely was a month old. They settled near Alto, Texas. Preely now lives in Tyler. \"I\\'m Preely Coleman and I never gits tired of talking. Yes, ma\\'am, it am Juneteenth, but I\\'m home, \\'cause I\\'m too old now to go on them celerabrations. Where was I born? I knows that \\'zactly, \\'cause my mammy tells me that a thousand times. I was born down on the old Souba place, in South Carolina, \\'bout ten mile from New Berry. My mammy belonged to the Souba family, but its a fact one of the Souba boys was my pappy and so the Soubas sells my mammy to Bob and Dan Lewis and they brung us to Texas \\'long with a big bunch of other slaves. Mammy tells me it was a full month \\'fore they gits to Alto, their new home. \"When I was a chile I has a purty good time, \\'cause there was plenty chillen on the plantation. We had the big races. Durin\\' the war the sojers stops by on the way to Mansfield, in Louisiana, to git somethin\\' to eat and stay all night, and then\\'s when we had the races. There was a mulberry tree we\\'d run to and we\\'d line up and the sojers would say, \\'Now the first one to slap that tree gits a quarter,\\' and I nearly allus gits there first. I made plenty quarters slappin\\' that old mulberry tree! \"So the chillen gits into their heads to fix me, \\'cause I wins all the quarters. They throws a rope over my head and started draggin down the road, and down the hill, and I was nigh \\'bout choked to death. My only friend was Billy and he was a-fightin\\', tryin\\' to git me loose. They was goin\\' to throw me in the big spring at the foot of that hill, but we meets Capt. Berryman, a white man, and he took his knife and cut the rope from my neck and took me by the heels and soused me up and down in the spring till I come to. They never tries to kill me any more. \"My mammy done married John Selman on the way to Texas, no cere\\'mony, you knows, but with her massa\\'s consent. Now our masters, the Lewises, they loses their place and then the Selman\\'s buy me and mammy. They pays $1,500 for my mammy and I was throwed in. \"Massa Selman has five cabins in he backyard and they\\'s built like half circle. I grows big \\'nough to hoe and den to plow. We has to be ready for the field by daylight and the conk was blowed, and massa call out, \\'All hands ready for the field.\\' At 11:30 he blows the conk, what am the mussel shell, you knows, \\'gain and we eats dinner, and at 12:30 we has to be back at work.

He kep\\' the bottle in the center of the dining table all the time and every meal he\\'d have the toddy. Us slaves et out under the trees in summer and in the kitchen in winter and most gen\\'rally we has bread in pot liquor or milk, but sometimes honey. \"I well \\'members when freedom come.

Her family had been slaves of Richard Coke, and remained with him many years after they were freed. Harriet recalls some incidents of Reconstruction days, and believes in the superstitions handed down to her from slave days. \"My birthday done come in January, on de tenth. I\\'s birthed in Houston, in 1870, and Gov. Richard Coke allus had owned my daddy and mammy, and dey stayed with him after freedom. Mammy, what was Julia Collins, didn\\'t die till 1910, and she was most a hundred year old. \"She done told me many a time \\'bout how folkses git all worked up over Marse Coke\\'s \\'lection. Mammy took lunch to de Capitol House to Marse Richard, and dere he am on de top floor with all he congressmen and dat Davis man and he men on de bottom floor, tryin\\' to say Marse Richard ain\\'t got no right to be governor dis here State. Old Miss and de folkses didn\\'t sleep a wink dat night, \\'cause dey thunk it sho\\' be a fight. Dat in 1873, Mammy allus say. \"De old place at Houston was like most all old places. Dere was little, small dormer windows, dey call \\'em, in upstairs, and big porches everywhere. Dere was \\'hogany furniture and rosewood bedsteads, and big, black walnut dressers with big mirrors and little ones down de side. Old Miss allus have us keep de drapes white as drifted snow, and polish de furniture till it shine. Dere was sofies with dem claw foots, and lots of purty chiny and silver. \"On de farm out from town dere was de log house, with quarters and de smokehouse and washhouse and big barns and carriage house. De quarters was little, whitewashed, log houses, one for de family, and a fence of de split palin\\'s round most of dem. \"De white and cullud chillen played together, all over de place. Dey went fishin\\' and rode de plough hosses and run de calves and colts and sech devilment. De little white gals all had to wear sunbonnets, and Old Miss, she sew dem bonnets on every day, so dey not git sunburnt. Us niggers weared de long, duckin\\' shirts till us git \\'bout growed, and den us weared long, dark blue dresses. Dey had spinnin\\' and weavin\\' rooms, where de cullud women makes de clothes. \"Old Miss, she sho\\' a powerful manager. She knowed jes\\' how much meal and meat and sorghum it gwine take to run de plantation a year. She know jes\\' how much thread it take for spinnin\\', and she bossed de settin\\' hens and turkeys and fixin\\' of \\'serves and soap. She was sho\\' good to you iffen you work and do like she tell you. Many a night she go round to see dat all was right. She a powerful good nuss, too, and so was mammy. \"De white folks had good times. Dey\\'d go hossback ridin\\' and on picnics, and fishin\\' and have big dinners and balls. Come Christmas, dey have us slaves cut a big lot of wood and keep fires all night for a week or two. De house be lit with candles from top to toe, and lots of company come. For dinner us have turkey and beef roast and a big \\'ginny ham and big bowls of eggnog and a pitcher of apple cider and apple toddy. All us git somethin\\' on Christmas and plenty eggnog, but no gittin\\' drunk. \"I can jes\\' see Marse Dick, tall and kinder stooped like, with de big flop hat and longtail coat and allus carryin\\' a big, old walkin\\' stick. He was sho\\' a brave man and de big men say dey likes dat flop hat, \\'cause dey done follow it on de battlefield. He had a big voice and dey do tell how, in de war, he\\'d holler, \\'Come on, boys,\\' and de bullets be like hail and men fallin\\' all round, but dat don\\'t stop Marse Dick. He\\'d take off dat flop hat and plunge right on and dey\\'d foller he bald head where de fight was hottes\\'. He was sho\\' a man! \"When I gits married it was eight folkses dere, I jus\\' walks off and goes to housekeepin\\'. I had a calico dress and a Baptist preacher marries us. \"Dere been some queer things white folks can\\'t understand. Dere am folkses can see de spirits, but I can\\'t. My mammy larned me a lots of doctorin\\', what she larnt from old folkses from Africy, and some de Indians larnt her. If you has rheumatism, jes\\' take white sassafras root and bile it and drink de tea. You makes lin\\'ment by bilin\\' mullein flowers and poke roots and alum and salt. Put red pepper in you shoes and keep de chills off, or string briars round de neck. Make red or black snakeroot tea to cure fever and malaria, but git de roots in de spring when de sap am high. \"When chillen teethin\\' put rattlesnake rattles round de neck, and alligator teeth am good, too. Show de new moon money and you\\'ll have money all month. Throw her five kisses and show her money and make five wishes and you\\'ll git dem. Eat black-eyed peas on New Year and have luck all dat year: \"\\'Dose black-eyed peas is lucky, When et on New Year\\'s Day; You\\'ll allus have sweet \\'taters And possum come you way.\\' \"When anybody git cut I allus burns woolen rags and smokes de wound or burns a piece fat pine and drops tar from it on scorched wool and bind it on de wound. For headache put a horseradish poultice on de head, or wear a nutmeg on a string round you neck. If you kills de first snake you sees in spring, you enemies ain\\'t gwine git de best of you dat year. For a sprain, git a dirt dauber\\'s nest and put de clay with vinegar and bind round de sprain. De dime on de string round my ankle keeps cramps out my leg, and tea from red coon-root good, too. All dese doctorin\\' things come clear from Africy, and dey allus worked for mammy and for me, too. 420187 ANDREW (Smoky) COLUMBUS was born in 1859 on the John J. Ellington plantation, one mile south of Linden, Texas. He continued in the service of the Ellingtons until about 1878, when he moved to Jefferson, Texas. He carried meals to Abe Rothchild, who was in jail, charged with the murder of Diamond Bessie Moore. Andrew was 37 years a servant of Hon. Tom Armistead, and was a porter in the Capital at Austin when Armistead was a senator. Andrew now lives in Marshall, Texas. \"I was bo\\'n a slave of Master John Ellington, who lived in Davis County (now Cass Co.), Texas. Master John had a big house and close by was a long, double row of slave quarters. It looked like a town. There was four boys and two girls in Master\\'s fam\\'ly and one daughter, Miss Lula, married Lon Morris, that run the Lon Morris School. \"Master John was one white man that sho\\' took care of his niggers. He give us plenty warm clothes and good shoes, and come see us and had Dr. Hume doctor us when we was sick. The niggers et ham and middlin\\' and good eats as anybody. Master John\\'s place joined the Haggard place, where they was lots of wild turkey and the slaves could go huntin\\' and fishin\\' when they wanted. \"We had a church and a school for the slaves and the white folks helped us git book learnin\\'. Mos\\' of the niggers allus went to preachin\\' on Sunday. \"The hands didn\\'t work Saturday afternoons. That\\'s when we\\'d wash our clothes and clean up for Sunday. There was parties and dances on Saturday night for them as wanted them. But there wasn\\'t no whiskey drinkin\\' and fightin\\' at the parties. Mammy didn\\'t go to them. She was religious and didn\\'t believe in dancin\\' and sech like. On Christmas Master John allus give the slaves a big dinner and it didn\\'t seem like slavery time. The niggers had a sight better time than they do now. \"Master John did all the bossin\\' hisself. None of his niggers ever run off \\'cause he was too good for them to do that. I only got one whippin\\' from him and it was for stealin\\' eggs from a hen\\'s nest. My pappy was carriage driver for Master. I didn\\'t do much of the work when I was a boy, jes\\' stayed round the house. \"Master John raised lots of cotton and after it was baled he hauled it to Jefferson on ox wagons. I\\'d allus go with him, ridin\\' on top of the bales. I\\'ll never forgit how scared I was when we\\'d cross Black Cypress on Roger\\'s Ferryboat and it\\'d begin to rock. \"I don\\'t remember much about the War. When it was over Master John calls all his slaves together and says, \\'You\\'se free now and you can go or stay.\\' He told the men who wanted to leave they could have a wagon and team, but most of them stayed. Pappy took a wagon and team and left but mammy and us children stayed and lived with Master Ellington \\'bout 15 years after the war was over. \"When I left Master John I moved to Jefferson and married Cora Benton and we had three boys and two girls. While I was in Jefferson Sheriff Vine goes to Cincinnati after Abe Rothchild, for killin\\' \\'Diamond Bessie.\\' Abe shot hisself in the forehead when he heared Sheriff Vine was after him, but it didn\\'t kill him. There was sho\\' some stirrin\\' about when the sheriff fotch Abe back to Jefferson. \"Mr. Sam Brown was the jailer. Abe wouldn\\'t eat the jail food and hired me to bring his meals to him from the hotel. His cell was fixed up like a hotel room, with a fine brussels rug and nice tables and chairs. He kep\\' plenty of whiskey and beer to drink. He\\'d allus give me a drink when I took his meals. \"I worked 37 years for Mr. Tom Armistead, who helped W.T. Crawford and his brother defend Rothchild. Mr. Eppenstadt, he was mayor of Jefferson then and acted as a go-between man in the case. \"Master Tom Armistead never married and I kep\\' house and cooked for him. He give me lots of fine clothes. I bet I owned more fine shirts than any nigger in Texas. He got me a job as porter in the Capitol at Austin while he was senator. I was workin\\' there when they moved in the new Capitol in 1888. They was gonna put on a big party and say all the porters had to wear cutaway suits. I didn\\'t have one, so the day \\'fore the party I goes over to Mr. Tom\\'s room at the Bristol Hotel and git one of his. I didn\\'t know then it was a right new one he had made for the party. When I goes back to the Capitol all dressed up in that cutaway suit, I meets Mr. Templeton Houston and he recognises the suit and says. \\'You sho\\' look fine in Mr. Tom\\'s new suit,\\' \\'bout that time Mr. Tom walks up and, you know, he give me that suit and had him another one made for the party! I wouldn\\'t live where there wasn\\'t no good white folks. 420218 [Illustration: Steve Conally] [Illustration: Steve Conally\\'s House] STEVE CONNALLY, 90, was born a slave of Tom Connally, grandfather of United States Senator Tom Connally, from Texas. The family then lived in Georgia, and Steve\\'s master was a member of the Georgia Legislature. \"I was born in Murray County, Georgia, and was a slave of Massa Tom Connally, but they called him Massa \"Cushi\" Connally. He was a member of de Georgia Legislature. I stayed with Missy Mary Connally till I was sixty-seven and Massa Cushi died when I was sixty-nine. \"My mother, Mandy, weighed two hundred pounds and she was de Connally cook.

I stays with Missy Mary till she die in Georgia. Her son, Jones Connally, come to Brazos County, near Bryan, and after dat removes to Eddy. I works for him two years and has lived round Eddy ever since. De Connallys give me a house and lot in Eddy. Some de fool niggers \\'spected a lot, but I wasn\\'t worryin\\' none.

She \"reckons I\\'s \\'bout twelve or maybe thirteen years old when all de cullud folks was made free.\" Laura\\'s memory is poor, but she made an effort to recall slave days. She lives at 2915 Nance St., Houston, Texas. \"Lawd have mercy \\'pon me, when you calls me Aunt Laura it seems jes\\' like you must be some of my white folks, \\'cause dat what dey calls me. I mean Papa Day\\'s chillen and dere younguns, when dey comes to see me. But it been de long time since any of dem come to see old Aunt Laura, and I reckon dey most all gone now. \"You know where Dayton is at? Well, dat\\'s where Papa Day\\'s plantation was at and where I\\'s borned. I don\\'t know when dat am, \\'zactly, but when all de cullud folks was made free, I reckons I\\'s \\'bout twelve or thirteen years old. \"Mama\\'s name was Maria Dunlap and daddy\\'s name was Saul. Mamma was de seamstress and don\\'t do nothin\\' but weave cloth on de spinnin\\' wheel and make clothes. Daddy from Lake Providence, I heared him say, but I don\\'t know where at dat is. He do all de carpenter work. I has five sisters and two brothers, but dey heaps older dan me and I don\\'t know much \\'bout dem. \"We \\'longs to Papa Day, his name Isaiah, but us all call him Papa Day, \\'cause he won\\'t \\'low none he cullud folks to call him master. He say us is born free as he is, only de other white folks won\\'t tell us so, and our souls is jes\\' as white, and de reason us am darker on de outside is \\'cause us is sunburnt. I don\\'t reckon dere am anybody as good to dere cullud folks as he was. \"Miss Martha, he wife, was mighty good, too. Does any us chillen git hurt or scratched, she fix us up and give us a hug. I knows dey has two boys and a gal, and dey comes to see me long time after I\\'s free and brings dere own chillen. But my mem\\'ry am sort of foggy-like and I can\\'t \\'member dere names now. \"De only work Papa Day \\'lows us chillen do am pick de boles close to de ground, and dat mostly fun, and us ride to de house on de wagon what takes de pickin\\' at night. Papa Day don\\'t make he cullud folks work Saturdays and Sundays and dey can visit round on other plantations, and he say nobody better bother us none, either. \"One time us chillen playin\\' out in de woods and seed two old men what look like wild men, sho\\' \\'nough. Dey has long hair all over de face and dere shirts all bloody. Us run and tell Papa Day and he makes us take him dere and he goes in de briar patch where dem men hidin\\'. Dey takes him round de knees and begs him do he not tell dere massa where dey at, \\'cause dey maybe git kilt. Dey say dey am old Lodge and Baldo and dey run \\'way \\'cause dere massa whips dem, \\'cause dey so old dey can\\'t work good no more. Papa Day has tears comin\\' in he eyes. Dey can\\'t hardly walk, so he sends dem to de house and has Aunt Mandy, de cook, fix up somethin\\' to eat quick. I never seed sech eatin\\', dey so hongry. He puts dem in a house and tells us not to say nothin\\'. Den he rides off on he hoss and goes to dere massa and tells him \\'bout it, and jes\\' dares him to come git dem. He pays de man some money and Lodge and Baldo stays with Papa Day and I guess day thunk dey in Heaven. \"One mornin\\' Papa Day calls all us to de house and reads de freedom papers and say, \\'De gov\\'ment don\\'t need to tell you you is free, \\'cause you been free all you days. If you wants to stay you can and if you wants to go, you can. But if you go, lots of white folks ain\\'t gwine treat you like I does.\\' \"For de longest time, maybe two years, dey wasn\\'t none of Papa Day\\'s cullud folks what left, but den first one fam\\'ly den \\'nother gits some land to make a crop on, and den daddy gits some land and us leaves, too. Maybe he gits de land from Papa Day, \\'cause it an\\'t far from his plantation.

We all want up to de big house and de jedge git up to make de speech, but am too choke up to talk. He hated to lose he slaves, I reckon. So his son-in-law has to say, \\'You folks am now free and can go where you wants to go. You can stay here and pick cotton and git fifty cents de hunerd.\\' But only two families stayed. De rest pulled out. \"After freedom we rented land on de halves. Some niggers soon got ahead and rented on de third or fourth. When you rent that-a-way you git three bales and de boss git one. But you has to buy you own teams and seed and all on dat plan. \"Its a fac\\' we was told we\\'d git forty acres and a mule.

Dat\\'s why us cullud folks don\\'t know our kinfolks to dis day. \"De best times was when de corn shuckin\\' was at hand. Den you didn\\'t have to bother with no pass to leave de plantation, and de patter rolls didn\\'t bother you. If de patter rolls cotch you without de pass any other time, you better wish you dead, \\'cause you would have yourself some trouble. \"But de corn shuckin\\', dat was de gran\\' times. All de marsters and dere black boys from plantations from miles \\'round would be dere. Den when we got de corn pile high as dis house, de table was spread out under de shade. All de boys dat \\'long to old marster would take him on de packsaddle \\'round de house, den dey bring him to de table and sit by he side; den all de boys dat \\'long to Marster Bevan from another plantation take him on de packsaddle \\'round and \\'round de house, allus singin\\' and dancin\\', den dey puts him at de other side de table, and dey all do de same till everybody at de table, den dey have de feast. \"To see de runaway slaves in de woods scared me to death. They\\'d try to snatch you and hold you, so you couldn\\'t go tell. Sometimes dey cotched dem runaway niggers and dey be like wild animals and have to be tamed over \\'gain. Dere was a white man call Henderson had 60 bloodhounds and rents \\'em out to run slaves. I well rec\\'lect de hounds run through our place one night, chasin\\' de slave what kilt his wife by runnin\\' de harness needle through her heart. Dey cotch him and de patter rolls took him to Henderson and hangs him. \"De patter rolls dey chases me plenty times, but I\\'s lucky, \\'cause dey never cotched me. I slips off to see de gal on de nex\\' plantation and I has no pass and they chases me and was I scairt! You should have seed me run through dat bresh, \\'cause I didn\\'t dare go out on de road or de path. It near tore de clothes off me, but I goes on and gits home and slides under de house. But I\\'d go to see dat gal every time, patter rolls or no patter rolls, and I gits trained so\\'s I could run \\'most as fast as a rabbit. \"De white chillun larned us to read and write at night, but I never paid much \\'tention, but I kin read de testament now. Other times at night de slaves gathers round de cabins in little bunches and talks till bedtime. Sometimes we\\'d dance and someone would knock out time for us by snappin\\' de fingers and slappin\\' de knee. We didn\\'t have nothin\\' to make de music on. \"We mos\\'ly lived on corn pone and salt bacon de marster give us. We didn\\'t have no gardens ourselves, \\'cause we wouldn\\'t have time to work in dem. We worked all day in de fields and den was so tired we couldn\\'t do nothin\\' more. \"My mammy doctored us when we was feelin\\' bad and she\\'d take dog-fenley, a yaller lookin\\' weed, and brew tea, and it driv de chills and de fever out of us.

At other time I wore white chillens\\' cast-off clothes so wore they was ready to throw away. I had to pin them up with red horse thorns to hide my nakedness. My dress was usually split from hem to neck and I had to wear them till they was strings. Went barefoot summer and winter till the feets crack open. \"I never seed my grandparents \\'cause my mother she sold in Alabama when she\\'s 17 and they brung her to Texas and treat her rough.

He used to raise 12 bales cotton a year and then drink it all up. We work from daylight till dark, and after.

When freedom was \\'clared, marster wouldn\\' tell \\'em, but mother she hear him tellin\\' mistus that the slaves was free but they didn\\' know it and he\\'s not gwineter tell \\'em till he makes another crop or two. When mother hear that she say she slip out the chimney corner and crack her heels together four times and shouts, \\'I\\'s free, I\\'s free.\\' Then she runs to the field, \\'gainst marster\\'s will and tol\\' all the other slaves and they quit work. Then she run away and in the night she slip into a big ravine near the house and have them bring me to her.

Adeline is tall, spare and primly erect, with fiery brown eyes, which snap when she recalls the slave days. The house is somewhat pretentious and well furnished. The day was hot and the granddaughter prepared ice water for her grandmother and the interviewer. House and porch were very clean. \"I was bo\\'n on ole man Foley\\'s plantation in Lavaca County.

He was a slave of the John Daily family and served as chore boy around the house, carried the breakfast to the field and always drove up the horses on the plantation. The latter duty developed a fondness for horses which led to a career as a race horse rider and trainer. He remained with his white folks several years after freedom and in Missouri many years longer in this work. He came to San Angelo, Texas in 1922 and took up hotel work which he followed until his health broke, only a few years ago. He now lives in his small home, in the colored district of the city and depends on his old age pension for a livelihood. \"Huh! What you say, did you say somethin\\' \\'bout de ole age pension?\", questioned Will when approached on the slavery question, but he answered readily, \"Sho! sho\\' I was a slave an\\' I aint ashamed to admit dat I was. Some of dese here fellers thinks dey sounds ole when dey says dey was slaves and dey denies it but I\\'s proud enough of de good treatment I\\'s got, to allus tell about it. My marster had a driver but he say his niggers was human, wid human feelin\\'s, so he makes dat driver reports to him fer what little thrashin\\'s we gits.

Den when I was bigger he starts me to carryin\\' de breakfast to de field whar de grown niggers had been out workin\\' since way \\'fore day. Dey all done dat. Dey say de days wasn\\'t long enough to put in enough time so dey works part of de night. \"We had good grub \\'cause we raised all de co\\'n and de hogs and de cows and chickens and plenty of everything. Mos\\' times we have biscuits and bacon and syrup for breakfast and butter too if we wants it but mos\\' niggers dey likes dat fat bacon de bes\\'. \"Our log cabins was good and comfortable. Dey was all along in a row and built out of de same kind of logs what our marsters house was. \"We had good beds and dey was clean. \"I nev\\'r had no money when I was a slave \\'cause I was jes\\' a small boy when de slaves was set free. \"We had lots of fish and rabbits, more den we had \\'possum but we sho\\' likes dat \\'possum when we could git it. \"My marster had about three hundred slaves and a big plantation. \"I seen some slaves sold off dat big auction block and de little chillun sho\\' would be a cryin\\' when dey takes dere mothers away from dem. \"We didn\\' have no jail \\'cause my marster didn\\' believe dat way, but I\\'s seen other slaves in dem chains and things. \"We didn\\' know nothin\\' \\'bout no learnin\\' nor no church neither and when de slaves die dey was jes\\' buried without no singin\\' or nothin\\'. \"When de war started, my father, he goes and once I remember he comes home on a furlough and we was all so glad, den when he goes back he gits killed and we nev\\'r see him no mo\\'. \"We had de doctor and good care when we was sick.

My brudders done lef\\' massa after the war and move nex\\' door to the Ware place, and one Saturday some niggers come and tell me my brudder Peter am comin\\' to git me \\'way from old missy Sunday night. That night the cows and calves got together and missy say it my fault. She say, \\'I\\'m gwine give you one hun\\'erd lashes in the mornin\\', now go pen them calves.\\' \"I don\\'t know whether them calves was ever penned or not, \\'cause Peter was waitin\\' for me at the lot and takes me to live with him on the Ware place. I\\'s so happy to git away from that old devil missy, I don\\'t know what to do, and I stays there sev\\'ral years and works out here and there for money. Then I marries and moves here and me and my man farms and nothin\\' \\'citin\\' done happened.\" 420046 [Illustration: Carey Davenport] CAREY DAVENPORT, retired Methodist minister of Anahuac, Texas, appears sturdy despite his 83 years. He was reared a slave of Capt. John Mann, in Walker Co., Texas. His wife, who has been his devoted companion for 60 years, was born in slavery just before emancipation. Carey is very fond of fishing and spends much time with hook and line. He is fairly well educated and is influential among his fellow Negroes. \"If I live till the 13th of August I\\'ll be 82 years old. I was born in 1855 up in Walker County but since then they split the county and the place I was born is just across the line in San Jacinto County now. Jim and Janey Davenport was my father and mother and they come from Richmond, Virginia. I had two sisters, Betty and Harriet, and a half brother, William. \"Our old master\\'s name was John Mann but they called him Capt. Mann. Old missus\\' name was Sarah. I\\'d say old master treated us slaves bad and there was one thing I couldn\\'t understand, \\'cause he was \\'ligious and every Sunday mornin\\' everybody had to git ready and go for prayer. I never could understand his \\'ligion, \\'cause sometimes he git up off his knees and befo\\' we git out the house he cuss us out. \"All my life I been a Methodist and I been a regular preacher 43 years. Since I quit I been livin\\' here at Anahuac and seems like I do \\'bout as much preachin\\' now as I ever done. \"I don\\'t member no cullud preachers in slavery times. The white Methodist circuit riders come round on horseback and preach. There was a big box house for a church house and the cullud folks sit off in one corner of the church. \"Sometimes the cullud folks go down in dugouts and hollows and hold they own service and they used to sing songs what come a-gushin\\' up from the heart. \"They was \\'bout 40 slaves on the place, but I never seed no slaves bought or sold and I never was sold, but I seen \\'em beat--O, Lawd, yes. I seen \\'em make a man put his head through the crack of the rail fence and then they beat him till he was bloody. They give some of \\'em 300 or 400 licks. \"Old man Jim, he run away lots and sometimes they git the dogs after him. He run away one time and it was so cold his legs git frozen and they have to cut his legs off. Sometimes they put chains on runaway slaves and chained \\'em to the house. I never knowed of \\'em puttin\\' bells on the slaves on our place, but over next to us they did. They had a piece what go round they shoulders and round they necks with pieces up over they heads and hung up the bell on the piece over they head. \"I was a sheep minder them days. The wolves was bad but they never tackled me, \\'cause they\\'d ruther git the sheep. They like sheep meat better\\'n man meat. Old Captain wanted me to train he boy to herd sheep and one day young master see a sow with nine pigs and want me to catch them and I wouldn\\'t do it. He tried to beat me up and when we git to the lot we have to go round to the big gate and he had a pine knot, and he catch me in the gate and hit me with that knot. Old Captain sittin\\' on the gallery and he seed it all. When he heered the story he whipped young master and the old lady, she ain\\'t like it. \"One time after that she sittin\\' in the yard knittin\\' and she throwed her knittin\\' needle off and call me to come git it. I done forgot she wanter whip me and when I bring the needle she grab me and I pull away but she hold on my shirt. I run round and round and she call her mother and they catch and whip me. My shirt just had one button on it and I was pullin\\' and gnawin\\' on that button and directly it come off and the whole shirt pull off and I didn\\'t have nothin\\' on but my skin. I run and climb up on the pole at the gate and sot there till master come. He say, \\'Carey, why you sittin\\' up there?\\' Then I tell him the whole transaction. I say, \\'Missus, she whip me \\'cause young marse John git whip that time and not me.\\' He make me git down and git up on his horse behin\\' him and ride up to the big house. Old missus, she done went to the house and go to bed with her leg, \\'cause when she whippin\\' me she stick my head \\'tween her knees and when she do that I bit her. \"Old master\\'s house was two-story with galleries. My mother, she work in the big house and she have a purty good house to live in. It was a plank house, too, but all the other houses was make out of hewed logs. Then my father was a carpenter and old master let him have lumber and he make he own furniture out of dressed lumber and make a box to put clothes in. We never did have more\\'n two changes of clothes. \"My father used to make them old Carey plows and was good at makin\\' the mould board out of hardwood. He make the best Carey plows in that part of the country and he make horseshoes and nails and everything out of iron. And he used to make spinning wheels and parts of looms. He was a very valuable man and he make wheels and the hub and put the spokes in. \"Old master had a big farm and he raised cotton and corn and \\'taters and peanuts and sorghum cane and some ribbon cane. The bigges\\' crops was cotton and corn. \"My father told us when freedom come. He\\'d been a free man, \\'cause he was bodyguard to the old, old master and when he died he give my father he freedom. That was over in Richmond, Virginia. But young master steal him into slavery again. So he was glad when freedom come and he was free again. Old master made arrangement for us to stay with him till after the harvest and then we go to the old Rawls house what \\'long to Mr. Chiv Rawls. He and my father and mother run the place and it was a big farm. \"I git marry when I was \\'bout 22 years old and that\\'s her right there now. We\\'s been married more\\'n 60 years and she was 17 years old then. She was raised in Grant\\'s colony and her father was a blacksmith. \"We had it all \\'ranged and we stop the preacher one Sunday mornin\\' when he was on the way to preachin\\' and he come there to her pa\\'s house and marry us. We\\'s had 11 children and all has deceased but three. \"I was educated since freedom, \\'cause they wasn\\'t no schools in slavery days, but after I was freed I went to public schools. Most my learnin\\' I got from a German man what was principal of a college and he teach me the biggest part of my education. \"When I was 14 a desperado killed my father and then I had my mother and her eight children to take care of. I worked two months and went to school one month and that way I made money to take care of \\'em. 420215 [Illustration: Campbell Davis] CAMPBELL DAVIS, 85, was born in Harrison Co., Texas, a slave of Henry Hood. He remained on the Hood place about three years after he was freed, then farmed in Louisiana. In 1873 he married and moved back to Harrison Co., where he farmed until old age forced him to stop. He now lives with his nephew, Billie Jenkins, near Karnack. Campbell receives a $12.00 per month old age pension. \"I\\'s big \\'nough in slavery time to hear dem tell de darkies to get up and go in the mornin\\', and to hear the whistlin\\' of dem whips and howlin\\' of de dogs.

I seed soldiers on hosses comin\\' and goin\\' de big road, and lots of dem come to Port Caddo in boats. De pretties\\' sight I ever seed am a soldier band all dress in de uniforms with brass buttons. When de soldiers come back from de war dey throwed cannon balls \\'long de road and us chillen play with dem. \"When de war am over, massa call us all and say we\\'s free, but can stay on and work for de victuals and clothes. A bunch leaves and go to de Progoe Marshal at Shreveport and ask him what to do. He tell dem to go back and wait till dey find work some place.

His family were the only slaves owned by Jonathan Draper, Baptist minister. In 1869 William joined the army and was stationed at Fort Stockton, Texas. He has lived in Houston since 1870. William is active and takes a long, daily walk. \"Well, suh, jes\\' sit down in de chair yonder and I\\'ll tell you what I can \\'bout times back yonder. Let\\'s see, now. I was born on de first day of April in 1845. De reason I knows was \\'cause Miss Lizzie, our missy, told me so when we was sot free. Mammy done told me I was born den, on de Tennessee river, near Kingston. I heared her say de turnpike what run past Massa John\\'s house dere goes over de mountain to Bristol, over in Virginny. Mammy and pappy and all us chillen \\'long to de Drapers, Massa Jonathan what us call Massa John, and he wife, Miss Lizzie, and we is de only cullud folks what dey owns. \"Massa John am de Baptist preacher, and while I\\'m sho\\' glad to see my folks sot free, I\\'ll tell de truth and say Massa John and Miss Lizzie was mighty good to us. Dey have four chillen; Massa Milton, what am oldes\\' and kill in de first battle; Massa Bob and Massa George and Massa Canero. Oh, yes, dey have one gal, Missy Ann. \"Course us didn\\'t have no last names like now. Mammy named Sophie and pappy named Billy. Sometimes de owners give de slaves last names \\'cordin\\' to what dey do, like pappy was meat cook and mammy cook pies and cakes and bread, so dey might have Cook for de last name. \"We has a bigger family dan Massa John, \\'cause dey eight of us chillen. I ain\\'t seen none of dem since I lef\\' Virginny in 1869, but I \\'member all de names. Dere was Jane and Lucy and Ellen and Bob and Solomon and Albert and John, and I\\'m de younges\\' de whole lot. \"I heared Miss Lizzie tell some white folks dat my mammy and pappy give to her by her pappy in Alabama when she get married. Dat de custom with rich folks den, and mammy \\'long to de Ames, what was Miss Lizzie\\'s name \\'fore she marry. I heared her say when de stars falls, I think she say in 1832, she was \\'bout eighteen, and dey think de world am endin\\'. \"Pappy was a Indian. I knows dat. He came from Congo, over in Africa, and I heared him say a big storm druv de ship somewhere on de Ca\\'lina coast. I \\'member he mighty \\'spectful to Massa and Missy, but he proud, too, and walk straighter\\'n anybody I ever seen. He had scars on de right side he head and cheek what he say am tribe marks, but what dey means I don\\'t know. \"\\'Bout de first I \\'members real good am where we am in Virginny and Massa John runs de Washington College, in Washington County. I \\'member all de pupils eats at massa\\'s house and dat de first job I ever had. \\'Scuse me for laughin\\', but I don\\'t reckon I thunk of dat since de Lawd know when. Dat my first job. Dey has a string fasten to de wall on one side de room, with pea fowl tail feathers strung \\'long it, and it runs most de length de room, above de dinin\\' table, and round a pulley-like piece in de ceilin\\' with one end de string hangin\\' down. When mealtime come, I am put where de string hang down and I pulls it easy like, and de feathers swishes back and forth sideways, and keeps de flies from lightin\\' while folks am eatin\\'. \\'Ceptin\\' dat, all I does is play round with Massa George and Missy Ann. \"Dey ain\\'t no whuppin\\' on our place and on Sunday us all go to church, and Massa John do de preachin\\'. Dey rides in de buggy and us follow in de wagon. De white folks sets in front de church and us in back. \"I can\\'t tell you how long us stay at de college, \\'zactly, but us moves to Warm Springs to take de baths and drink de water, in Scott County. Dat two, three years befo\\' de war, and Massa John run de hotel and preach on Sunday. I think dere am three springs, one sulphur water and one lime water and one a warm spring. I does a little bit of everything round de hotel, helps folks off de stage when it druv up, wait on table and sich. When I hears de horn blow--you know, de stage driver blow it when dey top de hill \\'bout two miles \\'way, to let you know dey comin\\'--I sho\\' hustle round and git ready to meet it, \\'cause most times folks what I totes de grips for gives me something. Dat de first money I ever seed. Some de folks gives me de picayune--dat what us call a nickel, now, and some gives me two shillin\\'s, what same as two-bits now. A penny was big den, jes\\' like a two-bit piece, now. \"But when war begin \\'tween de Yankees and de South, it sho\\' change everything up, \\'cause folks quit comin\\' to de Springs and de soldiers takes over de place. Massa Milton go to jine de South Army and gits kill. Morgan and he men make de Springs headquarters most de war, till de Yankees come marchin\\' through toward de last part. I know pappy say dem Yankees gwine win, \\'cause dey allus marchin\\' to de South, but none de South soldiers marches to de North. He didn\\'t say dat to de white folks, but he sho\\' say it to us. When de Yankees come marchin\\' through, de Morgan soldiers jes\\' hide out till dey gone. Dey never done no fightin\\' round Warm Springs. Lots of times dey goes way for couple weeks and den comes back and rests awhile. \"Den one mornin\\'--I \\'members it jes\\' like it yestiddy, it de fourth of July in 1865--Miss Lizzie say to me, \\'Willie, I wants you to git you papa and de rest de family and have dem come to de porch right away.\\' I scurries round quick like and tells dem and she comes out of de house and says, \\'Now, de Yankees done sot you free and you can do what you wants, but you gwineter see more carpet baggers and liars dan you ever has seed, and you\\'ll be worse off den you ever has been, if you has anythin\\' to do with dem. Den she opens de book and tells us all when us born and how old us am, so us have some record \\'bout ourselves. She tells me I\\'m jes\\' nineteen and one fourth years old when I\\'m sot free. \"She tell pappy Massa John want to see him in de house and when he comes out he tells us Massa John done told him to take a couple wagons and de family and go to de farm \\'bout ten miles \\'way on Possum Creek and work it and stay long as he wants. Massa has us load up one wagon with \\'visions. Pappy made de first crop with jes\\' hoes, \\'cause us didn\\'t have no hosses or mules to plow with. Us raise jes\\' corn and some wheat, but dey am fruit trees, peaches and apples and pears and cherries. Massa John pay pappy $120 de year, \\'sides us \\'visions, and us stays dere till pappy dies in 1868. \"Den I heared \\'bout de railroad what dey buildin\\' at Knoxville and I leaves de folks and gits me de job totin\\' water. Dey asks my name and I says William Davis, \\'cause I knows Mr. Jefferson Davis am President of de South durin\\' de war, and I figgers it a good name. In 1869 I goes to Nashville and \\'lists in de army. I\\'m in de 24th Infantry, Company G, and us sent to Fort Stockton to guard de line of Texas, but all us do am build \\'dobe houses. Col. Wade was de commander de fort and Cap\\'n Johnson was captain of G. Co. Out dere I votes for de first time, for Gen. Grant, when Greeley and him run for president. But I gits sick at de Fort and am muster out in 1870 and comes to Houston. \"I gits me de deckhand job on de Dinah, de steamboat what haul freight and passengers \\'tween Galveston and Houston. Den I works on de Lizzie, what am a bigger boat. Course, Houston jes\\' a little bit of place to what it am now--dey wasn\\'t no git buildin\\'s like dey is now, and mud, I tell you de streets was jes\\' like de swamp when it rain. \"Long \\'bout 1875 I gits marry to Mary Jones, but she died in 1883 and I gits marry \\'gain in 1885 to Arabelle Wilson and has four girls and one boy from her. She died \\'bout ten years back. Course, us cullud folks marry jes\\' like white folks do now, but I seen cullud folks marry \\'fore de war and massa marry dem dis way: dey goes in de parlor and each carry de broom. Dey lays de brooms on de floor and de woman put her broom front de man and he put he broom front de woman. Dey face one \\'nother and step \\'cross de brooms at de same time to each other and takes hold of hands and dat marry dem. Dat\\'s de way dey done, sho\\', \\'cause I seed my own sister marry dat way. \"I has wished lots of times to go back and see my folks, but I never has been back and never seed dem since I left, and I guess dey am all gone \\'long \\'fore now. I has jobbed at first one thing and \\'nother and like pappy tells me, I has trials and tribulations and I has good chillen what ain\\'t never got in no trouble and what all helps take care dere old pappy so I guess I ain\\'t got no complainin\\' \\'bout things. \"I dreams sometimes \\'bout de peach trees and de pear trees and de cherry trees and I\\'d give lots to see de mountains \\'gain, \\'cause when de frost come, \\'bout now, de leaves on de trees put on pretty colors and de persimmons and nuts is ready for pickin\\' and a little later on us kill de hawgs and put by de meat for de winter. \"De Lawd forgive me for dis foolishness, \\'cause I got a good home, and has all I need, but I gits to thinkin\\' \\'bout Virginny sometimes and my folks what I ain\\'t seed since I left, and it sho\\' make me want to see it once more \\'fore I die. 420281 ELI DAVISON was born in Dunbar, West Virginia, a slave of Will Davison. Eli has a bill of sale that states he was born in 1844. His master moved to Texas in 1858, and settled in Madison County. Eli lives in Madisonville, with one of his sons. \"My first Old Marse was Will Davison. My father\\'s name was Everett Lee and mama was Susan, and he come to see her twict a month, \\'cause he was owned by \\'nother master. \"Marse Davison had a good home in West Virginia, where I\\'s born, in Dunbar, but most of it \\'longed to he wife and she was the boss of him. He had a great many slaves, and one mornin\\' he got up and \\'vided all he had and told his wife she could have half the slaves. Then we loaded two wagons and he turned to his oldest son and the next son and said, \\'You\\'s gwine with me. Crawl on.\\' Then he said to he wife, \\'Elsie, you can have everything here, but I\\'m takin\\' Eli and Alex and these here two chillen.\\' The other two gals and two boys he left, and pulled out for Texas. It taken us mos\\' two years to git here, and Marse Will never sot eyes on the rest of his family no more, long as he lived. \"Marse never married any more. He\\'d say, \\'They ain\\'t \\'nother woman under the sun I\\'d let wear my name.\\' He never said his wife\\'s name no more, but was allus talkin\\' of them chillun he done left behind. \"We gits here and starts to build a one room log house for Marse Will and his two boys. My quarters was one them covered wagons, till he trades me off. He cried like a baby, but he said, \\'I hate to do this, but its the only way I\\'ll have anything to leave for my two boys.\\' Looks like everything done go \\'gainst him when he come to Texas, and he took sick and died. The boys put him away nice and loaded up and went back to Virginia, but the home was nailed up and farm lying out, and it took them mos\\' a year to find they folks. The mother and one gal was dead, so they come back and lived and died here in Texas. \"Marse Will was one more good man back in Virginia. He never got mad or whipped a slave. He allus had plenty to eat, with 1,200 acres, but after we come here all we had to eat was what we kilt in the woods and cornbread. He planted seven acres in corn, but all he did was hunt deer and squirrels. They was never a nigger what tried to run off in Texas, \\'cause this was a good country, plenty to eat by huntin\\' and not so cold like in Virginia. \"After I was traded off, my new master wasn\\'t so good to me. He thunk all the time the South would win that war and he treated us mean. His name was Thomas Greer. He kept tellin\\' us a black nigger never would be free. When it come, he said to us, \\'Well, you black ----, you are just as free as I am.\\' He turnt us loose with nothin\\' to eat and mos\\' no clothes. He said if he got up nex\\' mornin\\' and found a nigger on his place, he\\'d horsewhip him. \"I don\\'t know what I\\'d done, but one my old Marse Will\\'s chillun done settle close by and they let me work for them, and built me a log house and I farmed on halves. They stood good for all the groceries I buyed that year. It took all I made that year to pay my debts and that\\'s the way its been ever since. \"I married Sarah Keys. We had a home weddin\\' and \\'greed to live together as man and wife. I jus\\' goes by her home one day and captures her like. I puts her on my saddle behind me and tells her she\\'s my wife then. That\\'s all they was to my weddin\\'. We had six chillun and they\\'s all farmin\\' round here. Sarah, she dies seventeen years ago and I jus\\' lives round with my chillen, \\'cause I\\'s too old to do any work. \"All I ever done was to farm. That\\'s all this here nigger knew what to do. O, I\\'s seed the time when I never had nothin\\' to eat and my big bunch of chillun cryin\\' for bread. I could go to the woods then, but you can\\'t git wild game no more. In them days it was five or ten mile to your nearest neighbor, but now they\\'s so close you can stand in your yard and talk to them. \"I never done no votin\\', \\'cause them Klu Kluxers was allus at the votin\\' places for a long time after the niggers was freed. The niggers has got on since them old days. They has gone from nothin\\' to a fair educated folks. We has been kind of slow, \\'cause we was turnt loose without nothin\\', and couldn\\'t read and write. \"I\\'s worked for fifteen and thirty cents a day, but Lawd, blessed to our president, we gits a li\\'l pension now and that\\'s kep\\' me from plumb starvin\\' to death. Times is hard and folks had to do away with everything when they had that Hoover for president, but they will be straightened out by and by if they\\'ll listen to the president now. \\'Course, some wants to kill him, \\'cause he helps the poor, but it do look like we ought to have a li\\'l bread and salt bacon without upsettin\\' \\'em, when they has so much. 420162 ELIGE DAVISON was born in Richmond, Virginia, a slave of George Davison. Elige worked in the field for some time before he was freed, but does not know his age. He lives with one of his grandsons, in Madisonville, Texas. \"My birth was in Richmond. That\\'s over in old Virginny, and George Davison owned me and my pappy and mammy. I \\'member one sister, named Felina Tucker. \"Massa and Missus were very good white folks and was good to the black folks. They had a great big rock house with pretty trees all round it, but the plantation was small, not more\\'n a hunerd acres. Massa growed tobaccy on \\'bout 30 of them acres, and he had a big bunch of hawgs. He waked us up \\'bout four in the mornin\\' to milk the cows and feed them hawgs. \"Our quarters was good, builded out of pine logs with a bed in one corner, no floors and windows. Us wore old loyal clothes and our shirt, it open all down the front. In winter massa gave us woolen clothes to wear. Us didn\\'t know what shoes was, though. \"Massa, he look after us slaves when us sick, \\'cause us worth too much money to let die jus\\' like you do a mule. He git doctor or nigger mammy. She make tea out of weeds, better\\'n quinine. She put string round our neck for chills and fever, with camphor on it. That sho\\' keep off diseases. \"Us work all day till jus\\' \\'fore dark. Sometimes us got whippin\\'s. We didn\\'t mind so much. Boss, you know how stubborn a mule am, he have to be whipped. That the way slaves is. \"When you gather a bunch of cattle to sell they calves, how the calves and cows will bawl, that the way the slaves was then. They didn\\'t know nothin\\' \\'bout they kinfolks. Mos\\' chillen didn\\'t know who they pappy was and some they mammy \\'cause they taken \\'way from the mammy when she wean them, and sell or trade the chillen to someone else, so they wouldn\\'t git \\'tached to they mammy or pappy. \"Massa larn us to read and us read the Bible. He larn us to write, too. They a big church on he plantation and us go to church and larn to tell the truth. \"I seed some few run away to the north and massa sometime cotch \\'em and put \\'em in jail. Us couldn\\'t go to nowhere without a pass. The patterrollers would git us and they do plenty for nigger slave. I\\'s went to my quarters and be so tired I jus\\' fall in the door, on the ground, and a patterroller come by and hit me several licks with a cat-o-nine-tails, to see if I\\'s tired \\'nough to not run \\'way. Sometimes them patterrollers hit us jus\\' to hear us holler. \"When a slave die, he jus\\' \\'nother dead nigger. Massa, he builded a wooden box and put the nigger in and carry him to the hole in the ground. Us march round the grave three times and that all. \"I been marry once \\'fore freedom, with home weddin\\'. Massa, he bring some more women to see me. He wouldn\\'t let me have jus\\' one woman. I have \\'bout fifteen and I don\\'t know how many chillen. Some over a hunerd, I\\'s sho\\'. \"I \\'member plenty \\'bout the war, \\'cause the Yankees they march on to Richmond. They kill everything what in the way. I heared them big guns and I\\'s scart. Everybody scart. I didn\\'t see no fightin\\', \\'cause I gits out the way and keeps out till it all over. But when they marches right on the town I\\'s tendin\\' hosses for massa. He have two hosses kilt right under him. Then the Yankees, they capture that town. Massa, he send me to git the buggy and hoss and carry missus to the mountain, but them Yankees they capture me and say they gwine hang that nigger. But, glory be, massa he saves me \\'fore they hangs me. He send he wife and my wife to \\'nother place then, \\'cause they burn massa\\'s house and tear down all he fences. \"When the war over massa call me and tells me I\\'s free as he was, \\'cause them Yankees win the war. He give me $5.00 and say he\\'ll give me that much a month iffen I stays with him, but I starts to Texas. I heared I wouldn\\'t have to work in Texas, \\'cause everything growed on trees and the Texans wore animal hides for clothes. I didn\\'t git no land or mule or cow. They warn\\'t no plantations divided what I knowed \\'bout. Mos\\' niggers jus\\' got turn loose with a cuss, and not \\'nough clothes to cover they bodies. \"It \\'bout a year \\'fore I gits to Texas. I walks nearly all the way. Sometimes I git a li\\'l ride with farmer. Sometimes I work for folks \\'long the way and git fifty cents and start \\'gain. \"I got to Texas and try to work for white folks and try to farm. I couldn\\'t make anything at any work. I made $5.00 a month for I don\\'t know how many year after the war. Iffen the woods wasn\\'t full of wild game us niggers all starve to death them days. \"I been marry three time. First wife Eve Shelton. She run off with \\'nother man. Then I marries Fay Elly. Us sep\\'rate in a year. Then I marry Parlee Breyle. No, I done forgot. \\'Fore that I marries Sue Wilford, and us have seven gals and six boys. They all in New York but one. He stays here. Then I marries Parlee and us have two gals. Parlee die three year ago. \"The gov\\'ment give me a pension and I gits li\\'l odd jobs round, to get by. But times been hard and I ain\\'t had much to eat the las\\' few years. Not near so good as what old massa done give me. But I gits by somehow. \"I done the bes\\' I could, \\'sidering I\\'s turned out with nothin\\' when I\\'s growed and didn\\'t know much, neither. The young folks, they knows more, \\'cause they got the chance for schoolin\\'. 420278 JOHN DAY, 81, was born near Dayton, Tennessee, a slave of Major John Day. John lives in McLennan Co., Texas. \"I was born near three mile from Dayton. That\\'s over in Tennessee, and it was the sixteenth of February, in 1856. Master\\'s name was Major John Day and my father\\'s name was Alfred Day, and he was a first-class blacksmith. Blacksmithin\\' was a real trade them days, and my father made axes and hoes and plow shares and knives and even Jew\\'s harps. \"Master was good to my father and when he done done de day\\'s work he could work and keep the money he made. He\\'d work till midnight, sometimes, and at de end that war he had fifteen hundred dollars in Confederate money. I never seen such a worker. \"Master John thunk lots of father but he took de notion to sell him one time, \\'cause why, he could git a lot of money for him. He sold him, but my mama and even Old Missy, cried and took on so dat Master John went after de men what bought him, to git him back. Dey already done crossed de river, but master calls and dey brung my father back and he give dem de money back. Dat de only time master sold one of us. \"He was a preacher and good to us, never beat none of us. He didn\\'t have no overseer, but saw to all de work heself. He had twenty-five slaves and raised wheat and corn and oats and vegetables and fruit. He had four hundred acres and a house with twelve rooms. \"A man what owned a farm jinin\\' ourn, de houses half a mile apart. He had two slaves, Taylor and Jennie, and he whip dem every day, even if dey hadn\\'t done nothin\\'. He allus beatin\\' on dem, seemed like. One awful cold day in February, Taylor done go to Denton for somethin\\', and when he come back his master starts beatin\\' on him, and cursed him somethin\\' awful. He kep\\' it up till my mama, her name was Mariah, gits a butcher knife and runs out dere and say, \\'Iffen you hits him \\'nother lick, I\\'ll use this on you.\\' Old Missy was watchin\\' and backed her up. So he quit beatin\\' on Taylor dat time. But one day dat white man\\'s own son say to him, \\'Iffen you don\\'t quit beatin\\' on dem niggers, I\\'ll knock you in de head.\\' Den he quit. \"Master was in de Confederate army. He gits to be a major and after he done come out dat war he sho\\' hated anythin\\' what was blue color. I got hold a old Yankee cap and coat and is wearin\\' dem and master yanks dem off and burns dem. \"We heared dem guns in de Lookout Mountain battle. Dey sounded like thunder, rumblin\\' low. One day de Feds done take Dayton and de soldiers goes by our place to drive dem Feds out. Dere a valley \\'bout two miles wide \\'twixt our place and Dayton and we could see de Confederate soldiers till dey go up de hill on de other side. Long in evenin\\' de Confederates come back through dat valley and they was travelin\\' with dem Yankees right after dem. Dey come by our house and we was gittin\\' out de way, all right. Old Missy took all us chillen, black and white, and puts us under half a big hogshead, down in de stormhouse. \"De Yankees got to de place and \\'gin ransack it. Old Missy done lock dat stormhouse door and sot down on it and she wouldn\\'t git up when dey done tell her to. So dey takes her by de arms and lifts her off it. Dey didn\\'t hurt her any. Den dey brekks de lock and comes down in dere. I didn\\'t see whay dey hadn\\'t found us kids, \\'cause my heart beatin\\' like de hammer. Dey turned dat hogshead over and all us kids skinned out dere like de Devil after us. One de Yanks hollers, \\'Look what we done hatch out!\\' \"I tore out past de barn, thinkin\\' I\\'d go to mama, in de field, but it look like all de Yanks in de world jumpin\\' dere hosses over dat fence, so I whirls round and run in dat barn and dives in a stack of hay and buries myself so deep de folks like to never found me. Dey hunted all over de place befo\\' dey done found me. Us kids scart \\'cause we done see dem Yanks\\' bayonets and thunk dey was dere horns. \"Dem Yanks done take all de flour and meal and wheat and corn and smoked meat. After dat master fixes up a place in de ceilin\\' to store stuff, and a trap door so when it closed you couldn\\'t tell its dere. \"I lives in and round de old place till 1910, den comes to Texas. I jist works round and farms and gits by, but I ain\\'t never done nothin\\' worth tellin\\'. 420257 [Illustration: Nelsen Denson] NELSEN DENSON, 90, was born near Hambirg, Arkansas, a slave of Jim Nelson, who sold Nelsen and his family to Felix Grundy. Nelsen\\'s memory is poor, but he managed to recall a few incidents. He now lives in Waco, Texas. \"I\\'ll be ninety years old this December, (1937). I was born in Arkansas, up in Ashley County, and it was the twenty-second day of December in 1847. My mammy was from Virginny and pappy was from old Kentucky, and I was one of they eight chillen. Our owner, Marse Jim Densen, brung us to Texas and settled near Marlin, but got in debt and sold as all to Marse Felix Grundy, and he kep\\' us till freedom, and most of us worked for him after that. \"Marse Jim Densen had a easy livin\\' in Arkansas, but folks everywhere was comin\\' to Texas and he \\'cides to throw in his fortunes. It wasn\\'t so long after that war with Mexico and folks come in a crowd to \\'tect theyselves \\'gainst Indians and wild animals. The wolves was the worst to smell cookin\\' and sneak into camp, but Indians come up and makes the peace sign and has a pow wow with the white folks. Marse git beads or cloth and trade for leather breeches and things. \"I want to tell how we crosses the Red River on de Red River Raft. Back in them days the Red River was near closed up by dis timber raft and de big boats couldn\\'t git up de river at all. We gits a li\\'l boat, and a Caddo Indian to guide us. Dis Red River raft dey say was centuries old. De driftwood floatin\\' down de river stops in de still waters and makes a bunch of trees and de dirt \\'cumulates, and broomstraws and willows and brush grows out dis rich dirt what cover de driftwood. Dis raft growed \\'bout a mile a year and de oldes\\' timber rots and breaks away, but dis not fast \\'nough to keep de river clear. We found bee trees on de raft and had honey. \"It was long time after us come to Texas when de gov\\'ment opens up de channel. Dat am in 1873. \\'Fore dat, a survey done been made and dey found de raft am a hundred and twenty-eight miles long. When we was on dat raft it am like a big swamp, with trees and thick brush and de driftwood and logs all wedge up tight \\'tween everything. \"\\'Fore Texas secedes, Marse Jensen done sell us all to Marse Felix Grundy, and he goes to war in General Hardeman\\'s Brigade and is with him for bodyguard. When de battle of Mansfield come I\\'m sixteen years old. We was camped on the Sabine River, on the Texas side, and the Yanks on the other side a li\\'l ways. I \\'member the night \\'fore the battle, how the campfires looked, and a quiet night and the whippoorwills callin\\' in the weeds. We was \\'spectin\\' a \\'tack and sings to keep cheerful. The Yanks sings the \\'Battle Cry of Freedom\\' when they charges us. They come on and on and, Lawd, how they fit! I stays clost to Marse Grundy and the rebels wins and takes \\'bout a thousand Yanks. \"Most the slaves was happy, the ones I knowed. They figgers the white men fightin\\' for some principal, but lots of them didn\\'t care nothin\\' \\'bout bein\\' free. I s\\'pose some was with bad white folks, but not round us. We had more to eat and now I\\'m so old I wouldn\\'t feel bad if I had old marse to look after me \\'gain. 420131 VICTOR DUHON was born 97 years ago in Lafayette Parish, La., a slave of the Duhon family. His blue eyes and almost white skin are evidence of the white strain in his blood. Even after many years of association with English speaking persons, he speaks a French patois, and his story was interpreted by a Beaumont French teacher. \"My papa was Lucien Duhon and my mama Euripe Dupuis. I was born over in Louisiana in Lafayette Parish, between Broussard and Warville. I\\'m 97 years old now. \"I didn\\'t have brothers or sisters, except half ones. It is like this, my mama was a house servant in the Duhon family. She was the hairdresser. One day she barbered master\\'s son, who was Lucien. He says that he\\'ll shave her head if she won\\'t do what he likes. After that she his woman till he marries a white lady. \"My grandmama was stolen from Africa and she lived to be 125 years old. She died last year in April. I think I\\'ll live long as she did. There were fifteen slaves on the land what Duhon\\'s had but I never ran around with them. I had room at the back of the big house. You know, Madame Duhon was my grandmama. She was good to me. The only thing I did was look to my master\\'s horse and be coachman for Madame. Master had four sons. They were Ragant and Jaques and Lucien and Desire. Desire was shot at the dance. \"Master had about 100 acres in cotton and the corn. He had a slave for to hunt all the time. He didn\\'t do other things. The partridge and the rice birds he killed were cooked for the white folks. The owls and the rabbits and the coons and the possums were cooked for us. They had a big room for us to eat in. Where they cook they had a long oven with a piece down the middle. They cooked the white folks things on one side. They cooked their own things on the other. They had each ones pots and skillets. \"I didn\\'t play much with the black children. My time went waiting on my white folks. \"Sometimes the priest came to say Mass. The slaves went to Mass. The priest married and baptized the slaves. They gave a feast of baptizing. We all had real beef meat that day. \"When my mama had 22 years she married a Polite Landry slave. Then she went to the Landry plantation. There was often marrying between the two plantations. When they married the wife went to her man\\'s plantation. That made no difference. It wouldn\\'t be long before a girl from the other place marry into the man\\'s plantation. That kept things in balance. \"My mama married Fairjuste Williams. They had two sons and a daughter. I didn\\'t know them so much. They were half brothers and sister. \"I had 22 years when war came. You know what war I mean. The war when the slaves were set free. I wasn\\'t bothered about freedom. Didn\\'t leave master till he died. Then I went to work for Mr. Polite Landry. \"I was always in good hands. Some slaves ware treated bad. Mr. Natale Vallean beat up a slave for stealing. He beat him so hard he lay in front of the gate a whole day and the night. \"I worked on farms all my life. Then I came to Beaumont. About 23 years ago, it was. I worked at anything. Now I\\'m too old. I live with my daughter. +--------------------------------------------------------------+ | | | Transcriber\\'s Corrections: | | | | | | Page 3: Then (and weepin\\' when they sot us free.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook’s eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others. Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed. _Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers. Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: http://www.gutenberg.org This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks. ***FINIS**'"

Others can be found on Amazon or Barnes & Nobles, which may have genre tags. There is little consistency on genre availability, however."
