# Predicting a Book's Genre from its Summary using NLP

Genre is one of those well known but poorly defined concepts which haunt the creative world. The purpose of this project is to bring genre into the realm of scientific analysis by using NLP to predict a book's genre from its summary. This will benefit literary entities such as editors and publishers by facilitating some of their daily work. To this end, we trained a complement naive Bayes model on term frequency - inverse document frequency data for the summaries of 12,000+ books, targeting the genre of the text. Our model fails to perform as hoped, correctly predicting the genre of known texts about 1 in 5 times.
